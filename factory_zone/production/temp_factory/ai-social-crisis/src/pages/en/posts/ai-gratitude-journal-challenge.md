_"Write down just 3 things you are grateful for today. ...You say nothing comes to mind?"_

We are sensitive to what we lack or don't have, but insensitive to what we already have. A gratitude journal is a training to turn the brain's Attention from 'lack' to 'fulfillment'. It's hard at first, but it becomes much easier if AI finds topics and asks questions by your side.
