## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is an absolute lifesaver on rainy days or when the kids are bouncing off the walls. The true magic lies in the 'Hard' difficulty instructions. Traditional 'Simon Says' often fails to challenge the working memory of older toddlers, but by using AI to generate multi-step, imaginative commands (like "Simon says, balance on one foot while making an elephant trunk"), you force their brains to actively process and sequence information. It transforms a simple physical activity into a powerful cognitive exercise. If your child struggles at first, simply lower the difficulty and gradually build up their confidence!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use this for younger toddlers (e.g., 3-year-olds)?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just modify the `[Age]` variable to 3. The AI will adjust the vocabulary and physical requirements to be much simpler, focusing on single, basic actions.

- **Q: Which AI model is best for this?**
  - A: Any model works wonderfully! However, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT (GPT-4o) tend to be exceptionally creative and natural when coming up with playful, child-friendly scenarios.

1. **Expert Persona:** Assigning the "pediatric physical education teacher" role ensures the AI prioritizes safety and developmental appropriateness.
2. **Clear Context & Goals:** Specifying the indoor location (`[Location]`) prevents the AI from suggesting outdoor or dangerous activities.
3. **Tiered Difficulty:** Requesting Easy/Normal/Hard levels allows you to adapt the game on the fly based on the child's current attention span and energy level.
4. **Variable Design:** Using `[Theme]` allows parents to instantly customize the game to their child's current obsession (dinosaurs, princesses, superheroes).
