_"I haven't prepared anything for this week's session, what do I do?"_

It's the worry of every TRPG Master. You need a powerful **Scenario Hook** to drag players into the adventure. Stop with the cliché "You received a quest at the inn"! Create an exciting intro with AI.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input the players' current level and preferred genre.
2. AI suggests 3 types of scenario hooks (Combat, Mystery, Social, etc.).

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Quest to kill monsters."

### ✅ After (Result - Type B: Mystery)

- **Hook:** In the middle of the market, a wagon overturns, and 'living golden statues' spill out from broken wooden crates and run away. Merchants scream to catch them, but the statues scream, "Save us!"
- **Twist:** The statues are actually noble children cursed and transformed. The merchant was a warlock trying to kidnap and sell them.
