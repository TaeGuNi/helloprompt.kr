If you describe it in words like this, perfectly styled component code pops out.

    <div className="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow duration-300 bg-white">
      <img className="w-full h-48 object-cover" src={image} alt={title} />
      <div className="px-6 py-4">
