## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly useful during transitional seasons (like spring and autumn) when the diurnal temperature range is drastic. The real magic happens when you input both the morning low and the afternoon high. By specifying your style preference (like "Minimalist" or "Smart Casual"), the AI avoids generic suggestions and tailors the look to your actual wardrobe. I personally use this every evening before bed to lay out my clothes for the next morning—it completely eliminates decision fatigue and saves me at least 15 minutes of frantic searching when I'm rushing to commute.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well if I have a very limited wardrobe?**
  - A: Yes! You can modify the `Context` section to include a brief list of items you own (e.g., "I only have black jeans, white t-shirts, and a denim jacket"). The AI will mix and match strictly from your existing closet.

- **Q: Can it suggest outfits for specific events like weddings or job interviews?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just change the `[Style]` variable to the specific event (e.g., "Formal Wedding Guest" or "Corporate Interview") and the AI will balance the strict dress code with the practical weather forecast.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Precise Weather Mapping:** By asking the AI to explicitly analyze the temperature range, humidity, and wind, it prevents generic "wear a jacket" advice and provides actionable, time-of-day layering strategies.
2. **Style Personalization:** The `[Style]` variable ensures the output matches your aesthetic, making the advice actually usable rather than just a theoretical weather-appropriate outfit.
3. **Constraint on Practicality:** The strict warning against impractical items (like suede in the rain) prevents the AI from prioritizing style over real-world functionality.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Basic Input)

```text
What should I wear? It's 12 degrees to 20 degrees today.
```

_(Output)_
"You should wear layers. A t-shirt and a jacket is good. Wear jeans and sneakers."

### ✅ After (Pro Version Output)

```text
### 🌤️ Your Weather-Optimized Minimalist OOTD

**Weather Analysis:**
With a morning low of 12°C and an afternoon high of 20°C, today requires strategic layering. The 12°C morning will feel crisp, but you will easily overheat by 2 PM if your base layer is too thick.

**The Outfit:**
- **Outerwear:** A lightweight, unstructured trench coat or a cotton-blend mac coat. Easy to take off and carry in the afternoon.
- **Top:** A high-quality, breathable white cotton t-shirt.
- **Bottom:** Navy or charcoal tailored chinos.
- **Shoes:** Minimalist white leather sneakers (comfortable for walking, clean aesthetic).

**Accessories & Practicality:**
- **Accessory:** A lightweight scarf for the morning commute. It adds a touch of style and protects your neck from the 12°C chill, but fits easily into a bag later.
- **Why it works:** The trench coat blocks the morning breeze. Once the temperature hits 20°C, you can drop the coat and scarf, leaving a clean, perfectly acceptable minimalist base outfit that won't leave you sweating.
