_"The helplessness when red error messages fill the screen... ask AI first before scouring Stack Overflow."_

Server logs or compile error messages are often unfriendly. But the clues are always hidden inside. Since AI has learned vast patterns of log data, it finds the 'real problem' much faster than humans.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. It is difficult to find the core cause in thousands of lines of complex error logs.
2. AI learns vast log patterns to identify the Root Cause faster than humans.
3. Reduce debugging time by getting everything from cause analysis to specific solution steps.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
