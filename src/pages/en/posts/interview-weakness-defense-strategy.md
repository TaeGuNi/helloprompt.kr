## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Excuse/Lying)

```text
"Ah, that is... I studied hard but the professors gave grades weirdly...
And I traveled a bit during the break..."
(Looking irresponsible)
```

### ✅ After (Reframing)

```text
"Yes, it is true that my GPA is somewhat low as I was immersed in club activities.
However, I learned 'Leadership and Communication' that cannot be learned from books while leading 50 club members.
To supplement the lack of major knowledge, I obtained the Engineer certification after graduation, proving my basic skills."
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

There is no applicant without weakness. The interviewer looks at **'Attitude dealing with weakness'**.

The moment you confidently reveal a hidden card, the weakness becomes a 'Scar of Growth'. 🛡️
