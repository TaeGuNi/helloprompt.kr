## 💡 작성자 코멘트 (Insight)

While an AI cannot replace a licensed human therapist, it serves as an exceptional "emotional first-aid kit." I use this prompt whenever I feel overwhelmed after a stressful day. The beauty of this approach lies in the CBT framing: rather than just venting into a void, the AI helps you objectively untangle _why_ you are upset and gives you tiny, manageable steps to regain emotional control. By clearly defining the `[Context]` and `[Current Mood]`, you force the AI to tailor its empathy to your exact situation, entirely preventing the generic, robotic responses that usually make people feel even more isolated.

## 🙋 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work on the free version of ChatGPT or Claude?**
  - A: Absolutely. Even free models like ChatGPT (GPT-4o-mini) or Claude 3 Haiku are remarkably good at empathetic listening. However, Pro models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Gemini Advanced tend to offer a warmer, more nuanced "human" touch.

- **Q: Is my private information safe when I share my deep worries?**
  - A: You should always exercise caution. Avoid using real names, specific company names, or highly sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Keep the context focused on the _situation_ and your _emotions_ rather than specific, traceable details.

## 🧬 프롬프트 해부 (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing (Therapist Persona):** By specifically commanding the AI to act as a "warm-hearted psychological counselor" using "CBT techniques," we shift its default helpful-assistant tone into a therapeutic, empathetic register.
2. **Structured Vulnerability (Context):** Breaking down the input into "Background" and "Current Mood" prevents the AI from getting confused and ensures it addresses both the logical event and the emotional fallout.
3. **Actionable Recovery (Task):** Asking for "three small rituals" and an "affirmation" transforms the session from a mere venting exercise into a constructive emotional reset.
