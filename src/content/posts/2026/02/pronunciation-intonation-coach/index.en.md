> _"I'm reading it exactly as it's spelled, but native speakers still ask me to repeat myself."_

English is a language driven by **stress and rhythm**. If you pronounce every syllable with equal weight—like a robot—your message gets lost. For example, pronouncing "water" with a hard 't' feels unnatural compared to the fluid "wa-der" used by native speakers. This prompt visualizes the invisible rules of spoken English, allowing you to practice flawless pronunciation and shadowing even when you cannot listen to audio.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

One of the biggest hurdles in language learning is the inability to practice speaking while commuting, working in an open office, or studying in a quiet library. This prompt acts as your silent vocal coach. By mapping out the "invisible" rhythm of English (using the 🔴 and ⚪️ markers), it trains your brain to recognize the musicality of the language before you even open your mouth. I highly recommend using this to analyze scripts for upcoming presentations or tricky lines from your favorite TV shows. Once you see the rhythm visually, your tongue will naturally follow.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work for British or Australian English?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just change "standard American English" in the task instruction to "British English (RP)" or "Australian English" and the AI will adjust the phonetic spelling and linking rules accordingly.

- **Q: Can I use this for single words instead of full sentences?**
  - A: Yes! It's incredibly effective for multi-syllable words where stress placement is confusing (e.g., "pho-TO-gra-pher" vs. "PHO-to-graph").

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Structured Rhythm Mapping (Task 3):** By forcing the AI to use visual markers (🔴⚪️), we convert an auditory experience into a visual one, bridging the gap for visual learners.
2. **Focus on Connected Speech (Task 4):** Traditional dictionaries only show words in isolation. This prompt specifically asks for linking rules, which is the actual secret to sounding like a native speaker.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
Sentence: "What are you doing?"
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
**[IPA]**
/wɑt ər ju ˈduɪŋ/

**[Phonetic Spelling]**
**Wha**-der you **do**-in?

**[Rhythm & Stress]**
🔴 ⚪️ ⚪️ 🔴 ⚪️
(**Wha**-der-you-**do**-in)

**[Connected Speech Tips]**
- **Flap T:** When "What are" is spoken quickly, the 't' becomes a soft 'd' or 'r' sound, blending into "Wha-der".
- **Dropped G (Elision):** The 'g' at the end of "doing" is often dropped in casual speech, making it sound like "do-in".
```
