## A New Standard for Corporate AI Innovation

LG CNS is partnering with OpenAI to lead fundamental changes in the corporate work environment. According to recently revealed cases, complex data analysis and report writing tasks that previously required 12 hours of human effort were completed in just 20 minutes after implementing AI.

### Key Achievement: 12 Hours → 20 Minutes

This productivity enhancement is the result of 'intelligent collaboration' that goes beyond simple automation. LG CNS's system integration expertise combined with OpenAI's powerful Large Language Models (LLM) analyze vast amounts of internal corporate data in real-time to derive contextual insights.

*   **Maximizing Efficiency:** Reducing repetitive and time-consuming tasks by over 97%
*   **Improving Accuracy:** Minimizing human error and supporting data-driven decision making
*   **Cost Reduction:** Optimizing workforce operations and focusing on high-value tasks

### LG CNS and OpenAI Partnership

Through this collaboration, both companies plan to lead the Enterprise AI market. They are proposing tailored solutions such as providing private cloud-based AI models suited for security-critical corporate environments or applying company-specific tuning technologies.

An LG CNS official stated, "Our goal is AX (AI Transformation), which innovates the way we work, beyond simply adopting technology."

### The Future of Enterprise AX (AI Transformation)

AI is no longer an option but an essential survival strategy. The future presented by LG CNS and OpenAI is clear: a world where humans focus on creative and strategic tasks while AI perfectly supports them.

This achievement is just the beginning, and we expect even more disruptive innovations across various industries such as manufacturing, finance, and retail.
