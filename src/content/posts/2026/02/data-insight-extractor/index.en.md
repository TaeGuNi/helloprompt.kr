## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a lifesaver when you're handed a massive CSV file right before a meeting. The magic here is asking the AI to focus on the _business significance_ rather than just descriptive statistics. By forcing it to act as a "Business Strategy Consultant" and requiring "numerical evidence," you prevent the AI from giving vague answers like "sales went up." Instead, it will give you boardroom-ready statements like "Q3 revenue grew by 15%, primarily driven by a spike in enterprise renewals, indicating strong retention strategies." Always remember to anonymize sensitive customer information before feeding it into the AI!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use this with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, absolutely! However, models like ChatGPT Plus (GPT-4) or Claude 3.5 Sonnet tend to be much better at handling larger datasets and providing deeper, more nuanced business context.

- **Q: How much data can I paste at once?**
  - A: It depends on the context window of the AI you're using. For massive datasets, it's often better to aggregate the data into a pivot table first and paste the summarized pivot data rather than tens of thousands of individual rows. Alternatively, you can upload the Excel/CSV file directly if you are using ChatGPT Plus or Claude's Advanced Data Analysis features.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Dual Persona (Role):** By combining "Data Scientist" and "Business Strategy Consultant," the AI knows it must be mathematically accurate but communicate in business terms.
2. **Actionable Deliverables (Task):** Asking for "concrete areas for improvement" turns a passive analysis into an active strategy document.
3. **Strict Constraints:** Mandating "numerical evidence" grounds the AI's responses in reality and prevents hallucinations or generic advice.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
(Raw Jan-Dec Sales Table pasted as text)
Analyze this.
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
### 1. Key Patterns & Anomalies
- **Summer Surge:** Sales increased by 30% during the July-August period compared to the Q2 average.
- **Retention Drop:** The customer repurchase rate declined by 5% in November.

### 2. Business Significance
- The summer surge indicates high responsiveness to our seasonal promotional campaigns, suggesting our target demographic is highly active during holidays.
- The drop in the repurchase rate coincides with the recent pricing tier update, indicating potential churn among price-sensitive legacy users.

### 3. Proposed Actions
- **Capitalize on Seasonality:** Allocate 20% more marketing budget to summer campaigns next year to maximize this proven peak season.
- **Retention Audit:** Immediately review the existing customer success program and consider a targeted "win-back" discount for users who churned in November.
