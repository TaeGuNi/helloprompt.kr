> _"The players just started interrogating a random town guard... Uh, what's his name again? And what's his personality?"_

Every Game Master or writer knows the sheer panic of players going completely off-script and taking an intense interest in an unplanned, background extra. Responding with a generic "Uh... he's just a regular guard" instantly shatters the immersion you've worked so hard to build.

Here is your magic spell to instantly generate a living, breathing NPC complete with quirks, a distinct voice, and a compelling backstory—right on the spot.

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when prepping your session or when you need highly detailed, actable character notes.

> **Role:** You are a veteran character actor and master storyteller who has lived thousands of lives.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: The players have suddenly engaged in conversation with an unplanned passerby or a specific background character.
> - Goal: I need to seamlessly roleplay this character impromptu without breaking immersion.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Quickly generate a highly actable **Profile** for this NPC.
>    - **Name:** (Memorable and fitting the setting)
>    - **Appearance:** (One striking visual feature. e.g., A bright red nose, a missing earlobe)

## 💡 Writer's Insight

When running a tabletop RPG or writing a scene, the difference between a flat, forgettable world and a vibrant, immersive one lies entirely in the details of its background characters.

I highly recommend focusing heavily on the **"Quirk/Habit"** section of the prompt output. Giving an NPC a physical action—like wiping a dirty glass, aggressively chewing on a matchstick, or nervously adjusting their spectacles—grounds them in the scene and gives you, the GM, something physical to _actually do_ while roleplaying them. Furthermore, the "Hidden Secret" often spontaneously generates the absolute best, most memorable side quests that you never even planned for!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this prompt work well with free AI models?**
  - A: Yes, absolutely! Since generating a brief, imaginative character profile doesn't require heavy logical reasoning or complex coding, even free models like ChatGPT-3.5 or Claude 3 Haiku will produce fantastic, lightning-fast results.

- **Q: Can I use this for modern, sci-fi, or cyberpunk settings?**
  - A: Definitely! The prompt is entirely setting-agnostic. Just adjust the `[Job/Role]` and `[Race/Gender]` variables. For example, use "Corrupt corporate hacker" or "Space station janitor" instead of a medieval blacksmith.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Roleplay Prompting (Persona):** By assigning the AI the persona of a "veteran character actor," it naturally prioritizes actability, distinct voices, and expressive traits over dry, encyclopedic descriptions.
2. **Actionable Restraints:** Forcing the AI to focus on a _single_ visual trait and a _single_ physical quirk prevents information overload. This allows the Game Master to grasp the character at a glance and immediately start acting.
3. **Narrative Hooks:** The mandatory inclusion of a "Hidden Secret" or "Dilemma" instantly transforms a static, boring NPC into a dynamic, interactive storytelling opportunity.
