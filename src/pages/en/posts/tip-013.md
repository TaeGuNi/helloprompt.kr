_"What if people leave 10 seconds into the video? The content is good, but the delivery might be the problem."_

To be chosen by the YouTube algorithm, 'Average View Duration' is the most important factor. To achieve this, it's essential to throw a powerful hook at the beginning, maintain immersion in the body, and conclude cleanly. Ask AI for a script that applies this 'success formula'.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. The key to YouTube success is increasing Average View Duration.
2. Assign the role of a PD for a million-subscriber YouTuber to AI to receive a structured script from the opening hook to the closing.
