_"I can't even recognize the code I wrote... how do I untangle this spaghetti?"_

Everyone has experience with messy variable names and functions exceeding 100 lines due to rushing.
What if there were a secretary who refactors that code you're ashamed to show your colleagues into the **standard of 'Clean Code'**?
With this one prompt, you can catch readability, performance, and maintainability all at once.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Intuitively change variable/function names
2. Remove duplicate code and split functions
3. Apply modern syntax and optimize performance

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a senior software engineer with 20 years of experience and an expert in 'Clean Code'.
>
> **Context:** The code I wrote works, but readability is poor and maintenance is difficult. Variable names are not clear, and there is a lot of duplicate logic.
>
> **Task:**
> Refactor the code provided below according to the following criteria:
>
> 1. **Naming:** Change variable and function names so their intention is clear.
> 2. **Function Separation:** Split functions into smaller ones so each function does only one thing (SRP).
> 3. **Deduplication:** Extract repeating logic into separate functions or utilities.
> 4. **Comments:** Add comments only where explanations of 'why' the code was written that way are needed.
> 5. **Modern Syntax:** Apply the latest modern syntax for the language.
>
> **Code:**
>
> ```
> [Paste the code to be refactored here]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Never change the business logic (behavior) of the existing code.
> - Summarize and explain the major changes before and after refactoring in a list.
> - Show the output divided into code blocks and explanation blocks.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```javascript
function calc(d) {
  let t = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < d.length; i++) {
    if (d[i].price > 100) {
      t += d[i].price * 0.9;
    } else {
      t += d[i].price;
    }
  }
  return t;
}
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total shopping cart price.
 * Applies a 10% discount for items over 100.
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(items) {
  const DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD = 100;
  const DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.9;

  return items.reduce((total, item) => {
    const finalPrice =
      item.price > DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD ? item.price * DISCOUNT_RATE : item.price;
    return total + finalPrice;
  }, 0);
}
```

_Changes: `calc` -> `calculateTotalPrice`, `d` -> `items`, magic numbers to constants, used `reduce`._
