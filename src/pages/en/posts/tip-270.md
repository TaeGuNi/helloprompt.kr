_"The 30 minutes before sleep determine your condition for tomorrow. What do you do during that time?"_

Our brains like signals. If you repeatedly give the signal 'If I do this, I will sleep soon', you can make yourself sleepy like a conditioned reflex. This is the power of a sleep routine. Create a 'sleep ritual' that fits you perfectly with AI.
