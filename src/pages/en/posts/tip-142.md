_"NullPointerException? Where exactly is it Null?"_

They say 80% of development time is spent debugging. Error messages are unfriendly, and code is too complex. Instead of staring at the monitor until your eyes pop out, ask AI. It scans thousands of lines of code in 1 second without getting tired.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Analyzes error messages and related code to identify the Root Cause.
2. Provides Fixed Code and explains why it needs to be fixed.
3. Suggests Defensive Code to prevent recurrence.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** below and use it.

> **Role:** You are a `[Genius Bug Hunter and Software Engineer]`.
>
> **Context:** I ran the code and an error occurred or an unwanted result came out. I can't find the cause.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. **[Cause Analysis]**: Interpret the error message and pinpoint exactly which part of the code is the problem. (Logical error or syntax error)
> 2. **[Solution]**: Show the code with the bug fixed. (Mark changed parts with comments)
> 3. **[Prevention]**: Tell me what habits I should have to avoid this mistake in the future, or 'exception handling' code that would be good to add.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Situation)

`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` occurred in JavaScript.
(Beginner: "Map? Why a map?")

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

**[Cause Analysis]**
It happened because you tried to render the screen before receiving data from the API. The variable `userList` is still in an `undefined` state because data hasn't come in yet, but you used the `.map()` function on it, so an error occurred. It's an asynchronous processing issue.

**[Solution]**

```text
// Before fix: userList.map(...)
// After fix: Use optional chaining (?.)
userList?.map(user => ...)
```

I added the `?.` operator to execute map only when there is data.

**[Prevention]**
When writing API communication code, it's good to always assume 'data might come late' or 'might fail' and insert code like `if (!data) return loading...` first.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Bugs are not failures. They are the process of code becoming more perfect. (Of course, a bug right before leaving work is a disaster. Catch it quickly.)

Now leave work on time and enjoy a bug-free life! 🍷
