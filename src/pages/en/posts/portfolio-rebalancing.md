_"Don't put eggs in one basket, is your basket condition okay?"_

The standard of investment is asset allocation, but as time passes, specific assets become too big or small, breaking balance. This prompt analyzes current asset weight, calculates gap with target weight, and tells "what and how much to sell and buy" with specific quantity.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Analyze weight by asset class of current portfolio
2. Compare with Target Weight and calculate excess/deficiency
3. Present specific rebalancing Action Plan including Buy/Sell quantity
