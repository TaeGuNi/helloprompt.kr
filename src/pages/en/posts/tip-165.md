_"I did a lot of work, but why does it look like I did nothing when I write the weekly report?"_

The weekly report is an opportunity to prove my performance, not a diary. The boss wants 'Results', 'Problems', and 'Next Plans'. Organize the scattered work pieces into a highly readable report with AI.

---

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Organize tasks into 'Completed', 'In Progress', 'Scheduled'.
2. Highlight key achievements numerically (%).
3. Clearly share issues requiring decision-making.
