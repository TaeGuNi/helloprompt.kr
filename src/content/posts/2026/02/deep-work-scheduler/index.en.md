## 🚀 The Solution: "Dawn Protocol Builder"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need a quick, generic morning routine.

> **Role:** You are an elite productivity coach and expert in deep work.
> **Task:** Create a 2-hour early morning schedule for me. I wake up at `[Time, e.g., 5:30 AM]` and my main goal is `[Your Goal, e.g., writing a book]`. Give me a minute-by-minute breakdown.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this for a highly customized, scientifically backed deep work session.

> **Role (Role):** You are an elite performance coach specializing in the neuroscience of flow states and Cal Newport's "Deep Work" philosophy.
>
> **Context (Context):**
>
> - Current Wake-up Time: `[e.g., 5:00 AM]`
> - Primary Goal (The One Thing): `[e.g., Programming a new SaaS feature]`
> - Biggest Morning Distraction: `[e.g., Checking the news/social media]`
> - Chronotype/Energy Level: `[e.g., Takes 15 minutes to fully wake up, then highly focused]`
>
> **Task (Task):**
>
> 1. Design a rigorous 2-hour deep work schedule (120 minutes) starting from my wake-up time.
> 2. Break the session down into specific phases: Wake-up/Hydration, Cognitive Warm-up, Deep Work Blocks (e.g., Pomodoro), and Cool-down.
> 3. Provide concrete strategies to eliminate my `[Biggest Morning Distraction]`.
> 4. Indicate variables that I need to fill in using brackets.
>
> **Constraints (Constraints):**
>
> - Format the schedule as a Markdown table with columns: Time, Phase, Activity, and Duration.
> - Do not include generic advice like "eat a good breakfast"; focus strictly on maximizing cognitive output during these 2 hours.
>
> **Warning (Warning):**
>
> - If the goal is too broad to achieve meaningful progress in 2 hours, politely suggest breaking it down into a smaller sub-task first. (Prevent hallucination and over-promising).

## 💡 Writer's Insight

As someone who struggled for years to establish a consistent morning routine, the game-changer wasn't just setting an earlier alarm—it was knowing _exactly_ what to do the moment my feet hit the floor. When I leave the planning for the morning, decision fatigue sets in, and I end up watching YouTube.

By running this prompt the night before, you wake up to an executive order. The "Cognitive Warm-up" phase built into the Pro Version is particularly crucial; it bridges the gap between grogginess and intense focus, preventing the burnout that often comes from jumping straight into complex coding or writing.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: What if I'm naturally a night owl?**
  - A: You can easily adapt this prompt! Just change the "Wake-up Time" to your late-night starting hour (e.g., 11:00 PM) and adjust the context to reflect your late-night energy peaks. Deep work applies to any uninterrupted block of time.

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, GPT-3.5 or the free tier of Claude can handle the Basic version perfectly. However, for the Pro version, models like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet excel at applying the "Deep Work" philosophy and formatting the output cleanly.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (No AI Planning)

```text
5:00 AM - Wake up, feel tired.

5:30 AM - Make coffee, stare at the wall.
5:45 AM - Open laptop, look at 5 different projects, feel overwhelmed.
6:30 AM - Write 3 lines of code.
7:00 AM - Get ready for work, feeling unaccomplished.
```

### ✅ After (Using Pro Prompt)

```text
| Time | Phase | Activity | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5:00 AM | Wake-up | Drink 500ml of water, quick stretching, no screens. | 10 min |
| 5:10 AM | Warm-up | Review yesterday's code logic, sketch today's architecture on paper. | 20 min |
| 5:30 AM | Deep Work | Uninterrupted coding: Implement the user authentication module. | 60 min |
| 6:30 AM | Break | Short walk around the room, rest eyes. | 5 min |
| 6:35 AM | Deep Work | Code review and writing unit tests for the module. | 20 min |
| 6:55 AM | Cool-down | Document progress and define the starting point for tomorrow. | 5 min |
