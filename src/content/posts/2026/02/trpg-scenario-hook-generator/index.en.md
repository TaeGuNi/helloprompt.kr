## 🚀 The Solution: "Adventure Start Generator"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when your players are already at the table and you need a quick burst of inspiration.

> **Role:** You are a veteran TRPG Game Master and master storyteller.
> **Request:** I am a GM with zero session prep time. Generate 3 exciting introductory scenario hooks that will immediately plunge my players into an adventure.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this for highly tailored, campaign-specific hooks that fit your party's exact dynamics.

> **Role:** You are a veteran TRPG Game Master and an expert in narrative design.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: I have a session tonight, but the opening scenario isn't ready. I need an incredibly compelling introductory hook that the players simply cannot ignore.
>
> **Party Info:**
>
> - **System:** `[e.g., D&D 5e, Call of Cthulhu, Pathfinder]`
> - **Party Level/Tendency:** `[e.g., Level 3, chaotic good, motivated by gold but fundamentally heroic]`
> - **Current Location:** `[e.g., A bustling, rain-slicked market in a port city]`
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Suggest **3 Scenario Hooks**, each catering to a different playstyle:
>    - **Type A (Combat/Action):** A sudden ambush, raid, or immediate crisis.
>    - **Type B (Mystery):** A bizarre phenomenon, an unexplainable event, or the discovery of a strange artifact.
>    - **Type C (Dilemma):** A tense situation forcing a difficult moral choice.
> 2. Add one **"Hidden Twist"** for each hook. (A secret truth the players will uncover later).
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - The hook MUST immerse the players and demand action within the first 5 minutes of the session.
> - Start with an intuitive, immediate event rather than a dense lore dump or overly complex setting description.
> - Present the output in a clean, easy-to-read Markdown format.

## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

As a GM, the hardest part of any session is the first five minutes. If you lose their attention early, it's a struggle to get it back. This prompt is incredibly effective because it doesn't just generate generic quests; it forces the AI to categorize the hooks by _player engagement type_ (Combat, Mystery, Dilemma).

By providing the system, level, and party tendency, you ensure the AI balances the encounter appropriately. The real magic, however, is the **"Hidden Twist"** variable. It transforms a one-dimensional starting quest into a multi-layered narrative that makes you look like you spent weeks planning it.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work for sci-fi or modern horror TRPGs like Cyberpunk or Call of Cthulhu?**
  - A: Absolutely. The prompt is system-agnostic. Just change the `[System]` and `[Current Location]` variables (e.g., to "Cyberpunk RED" and "Neon-lit back alley in Night City"), and the AI will adapt the tone and tropes perfectly.

- **Q: What if my players do something completely unexpected and ignore the hook?**
  - A: That's the beauty of generating _three_ distinct options. If they walk away from the Combat hook, you can seamlessly drop the Mystery or Dilemma hook into their path later in the session. You can also feed their unexpected action back into the AI to generate a consequence on the fly.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing (Persona):** By assigning the AI the role of a "veteran TRPG Game Master," it adopts a dramatic, descriptive tone suitable for tabletop gaming.
2. **Structured Variety:** Demanding three specific types of hooks (Action, Mystery, Dilemma) ensures you have options regardless of the mood at the table.
3. **Pacing Constraints:** The constraint "Must immerse players within first 5 minutes" prevents the AI from generating boring lore dumps and forces it to create immediate, actionable events.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Simple Input)

> "Give me a quest about catching a monster."

_Result: "The mayor asks you to go to the forest and kill a goblin that has been stealing sheep. He will pay you 50 gold pieces." (Boring, cliché, lacks urgency)._

### ✅ After (Using the Pro Prompt - Type B: Mystery)

_Result:_

- **The Hook:** A merchant's reinforced wagon suddenly overturns in the middle of the crowded market. Instead of cabbages or cloth, a dozen 'living golden statues' of small children spill from the shattered wooden crates. As the panicked merchant screams for the guards to catch his "stolen merchandise," the statues look directly at the party and whisper in unison, "Save us!"
- **The Twist:** The statues are actually abducted noble children transformed by a petrification curse. The merchant is a warlock attempting to smuggle them out of the city to sell to a wealthy collector.
