It's embarrassing to ask a friend to check, and there's no feedback practicing alone.
Now, face off 1:1 with an AI interviewer. Pressure interviews with tail-biting questions are also possible.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### 🗣️ Interview Simulation Example

**🤖 AI Interviewer:** "Welcome. Can you briefly explain the working principle of `Garbage Collection` in Java?"

**👤 Me:** "Um... it's a function that deletes objects that are no longer used from heap memory."

**🤖 AI Interviewer (Feedback & Follow-up):** "The core is correct, but it's too brief. Then, by what algorithm does GC judge 'unused objects'? Please explain including the concept of `Reachability`."

**👤 Me:** (Oops, what was Reachability...) "Objects that are not reachable from the Root Set..."
