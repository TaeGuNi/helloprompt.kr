# Research Log: 2026-02-14

## 1. Process Metadata

- **Trigger:** Cron (research-automation-bot)
- **Domain:** Dermatology / Skincare Tech / Regenerative Aesthetics
- **Status:** Partial (External Data Sync Failed - Missing API Key)

## 2. Topic Focus: Regenerative & Tech-Driven Skincare

Due to lack of live web access, this entry synthesizes core pillars of current high-performance dermatology trends for self-reinforcement.

### A. Polynucleotides (PN) & PDRN

- **Mechanism:** DNA fragments (typically salmon-derived) that stimulate adenosine receptors (A2A).
- **Effect:** Upregulates VEGF, enhances fibroblast activity, promotes collagen synthesis.
- **Application:** "Skin boosters," tear trough rejuvenation, wound healing.
- **Key Metric:** Improvement in skin density and elasticity.

### B. Exosome Therapy

- **Mechanism:** Extracellular vesicles carrying mRNA, miRNA, and proteins for cell signaling.
- **Source:** Plant-derived (rose, cica) vs. Human-derived (stem cells - regulation varies by region).
- **Trend:** Shift towards shelf-stable, lyophilized formulations for topical post-procedure application.

### C. AI in Dermatology

- **Diagnostics:** High-fidelity computer vision for early melanoma detection.
- **Personalization:** Algorithms analyzing skin microbiome and phenotypic data to prescribe custom active ingredient stacks.

## 3. Action Items

- [CRITICAL] Configure `BRAVE_API_KEY` in OpenClaw gateway to enable live data fetching.
- [NEXT] specific search on "Exosome regulation FDA vs KR 2026".

## 4. Update: Exosome Deep Dive (18:40)

- **Action:** Created supplemental research file.
- **File:** `memory/research/skin-expert/exosome-deep-dive-2026.md`
- **Focus:** Mechanism of Action (miRNA transfer), Sourcing (Human vs Plant), and the 2026 stability breakthrough (room-temp encapsulation).
- **Status:** Complete.
