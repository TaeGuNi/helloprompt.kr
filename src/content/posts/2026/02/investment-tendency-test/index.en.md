Investing without knowing your true risk tolerance is a recipe for disaster. You might think you're aggressive, buy Bitcoin at the top, and panic sell during a crash. Conversely, you might believe you're conservative, stick only to savings accounts, and let inflation quietly erode your wealth. It's time to measure your actual 'risk appetite' through an AI-driven, scenario-based simulation. Stop relying on the boring multiple-choice surveys at the bank.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Standard risk tolerance questionnaires at financial institutions are notoriously flawed because they ask logical questions about emotional situations. People often overestimate their risk tolerance when the market is up and underestimate it when the market is down. This AI prompt is powerful because it uses _scenario-based stress testing_. By placing you in a vivid, hypothetical market crash, it bypasses your logical brain and taps into your emotional reactions, providing a much more accurate assessment of what your asset allocation should actually be. I highly recommend running this simulation before making any major adjustments to your portfolio.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Do I need a paid version of ChatGPT for this?**
  - A: No, the free versions of ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini handle interactive scenarios perfectly well. However, more advanced models might provide slightly more nuanced and realistic crisis scenarios.

- **Q: Can I use this for crypto investments specifically?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just modify the prompt slightly to tell the AI to "focus on extreme crypto market scenarios" instead of general stock market fluctuations.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the role of a "Behavioral Economics Counselor," the AI analyzes your answers through a psychological lens rather than just doing basic math.
2. **Interactive Constraint:** Forcing the AI to ask questions one by one prevents overwhelming the user and ensures genuine, spontaneous reactions to each unfolding crisis.

### 🧠 Investment Tendency Diagnosis Result: [Aggressive Investor] (Growth-Oriented)

**1. Diagnosis Basis**
- You chose to inject additional funds, judging a -20% bear market as a "buying opportunity" rather than a time to panic.
- You demonstrated that you perceive the risk of inflation (failing to hedge) as significantly greater than the risk of temporary principal loss.

**2. Recommended Portfolio (60 : 30 : 10)**
- 📈 **Stocks (60%):** Primarily growth assets like S&P 500 ETFs and tech sector stocks.
- 🛡️ **Bonds (30%):** Government bonds or blue-chip corporate bonds to defend against extreme volatility.
- 💰 **Cash (10%):** "Dry powder" kept in reserve to capitalize on severe bear market dips.

**3. Mental Management Advice**
You have the stomach for volatility, but beware of the "Overconfidence Bias." Always keep in mind that "I might be wrong" and make rigorous diversification an unbreakable rule in your strategy.
