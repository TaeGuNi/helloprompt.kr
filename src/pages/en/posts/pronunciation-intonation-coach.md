_"I read it literally, but native speakers can't understand."_

English is a language of 'Stress' and 'Rhythm'. If you read honestly as spelled, you sound like a robot. Just like "Water" is not understood if said "Water" (Korean pronunciation style) but understood if said "Wa-ter". This prompt visualizes the invisible rules of sound into text, helping you practice pronunciation even without sound.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Provide 'Pronunciation as it sounds written in native language' along with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
2. Visualize Stress and Intonation with emojis and symbols.
3. Teach tips on reading naturally by analyzing Linking rules.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"What are you doing?"

### ✅ After (Result)

**[IPA]**
/wɑt ər ju ˈduɪŋ/

**[Native Reading]**
**Wha**-der you **do**-ing?

**[Rhythm & Stress]**
🔴⚪️⚪️🔴⚪️
(What-are-you-DO-ing)

**[Linking Tips]**

- When 'What are' is pronounced quickly, 't' changes to soft 'r' sound (Flap T) so it sounds like "Wha-der".
- Swallow the end 'g' sound of 'doing' so it's barely heard.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Even in places where it's hard to make sound like libraries or offices, 'Shadowing' practice is possible with this prompt. Read the rhythm with your eyes.
