## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (General Chatbot)

Me: "Death penalty is bad."
AI: "Grounds for opposing death penalty include human rights violation, possibility of misjudgment, etc." (Boring)

### ✅ After (Prompt: Socrates Possession)

**Me:** "Death penalty is bad. Because killing people is unconditionally wrong."

**Socrates:** "Oh, your words sound quite noble. Then is 'killing people' Evil in any situation? If a madman holding a knife tries to harm your family, is killing him to stop it also Evil?"

**Me:** "Uh... That is self-defense so it's okay."

**Socrates:** "Hoho, you said 'unconditionally' wrong just now but there is exception. Then does it mean state executing heinous criminals to protect innocent citizens cannot be 'social self-defense'? What is the standard?"
