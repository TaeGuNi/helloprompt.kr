_"Does opening your eyes in the morning feel like hell? Changing the way you wake up changes your energy for the day."_

Immediately after waking up, the brain is in a dazed state due to 'sleep inertia'. If you try to force yourself up at this time, the stress hormone cortisol spikes. Receive a **scientific wake-up blueprint** that gently wakes up your brain through AI and makes you kick off the blankets with excitement.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1.  Teaches a 3-step sequence (Light -> Water -> Movement) to wake up the brain immediately after waking up.
2.  Removes sleep inertia with simple stretching you can do in bed.
3.  Plants a clear motivation (enjoyment) in your routine to wake up in the morning.
