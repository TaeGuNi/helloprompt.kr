# Building a Golf Game with Claude Code

The landscape of game development is shifting rapidly. With tools like **Claude Code**, the barrier to entry for creating complex, interactive experiences has never been lower. In this post, I'll walk you through how I built a 2D golf game using Claude Code as my primary development partner.

## Why Claude Code?

Claude Code isn't just an autocomplete engine; it's a reasoning agent capable of understanding architectural patterns in game development. For this project, I wanted to test its ability to handle:
- Physics calculations (velocity, friction, collision)
- Game state management (scores, turns, levels)
- Rendering logic (HTML5 Canvas)

## The Setup

I started with a simple prompt:
> "Create a browser-based 2D golf game using HTML5 Canvas. It should have a ball, a hole, and drag-to-shoot mechanics."

Claude didn't just spit out a snippet; it provided a structured setup:
1. `index.html` for the canvas container.
2. `game.js` encapsulation the game loop.
3. `physics.js` for handling the vector math.

## Step 1: The Physics Engine

The core of any golf game is the "feel" of the ball. I asked Claude to implement a simple friction model.

```javascript
// Generated by Claude Code
update() {
  this.velocity.x *= 0.98; // Friction
  this.velocity.y *= 0.98;
  
  this.x += this.velocity.x;
  this.y += this.velocity.y;
  
  // Wall collision
  if (this.x < 0 || this.x > canvas.width) this.velocity.x *= -1;
  if (this.y < 0 || this.y > canvas.height) this.velocity.y *= -1;
}
```

It correctly identified the need for damping velocity over time to simulate grass resistance.

## Step 2: Input Handling

Implementing the "drag-to-shoot" mechanic usually involves tedious event listener management. Claude suggested a visual indicator line to show power and direction before the shot.

It handled `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events seamlessly, calculating the angle between the mouse pointer and the ball to determine the impulse vector.

## Step 3: Level Design

Here is where it got interesting. I asked, "Generate 3 distinct levels with increasing difficulty, adding obstacles."

Claude introduced an `Obstacle` class and an array of level configurations. Level 1 was an open field. Level 2 added a central block. Level 3 created a narrow corridor. The code was modular enough that adding Level 4 took me seconds.

## Conclusion

Building this golf game took less than an hour. The code is clean, commented, and easy to extend. Claude Code didn't just write the code; it acted as a senior developer pairing with me, suggesting improvements to the game loop and modularizing the physics logic.

If you haven't tried AI-assisted game dev yet, now is the time.

## Future Improvements

- Adding wind mechanics.
- Multiplayer support via WebSockets.
- Mobile touch support.

Happy coding!
