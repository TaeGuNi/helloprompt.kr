<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert Detail)

Use this for a comprehensive, highly customized recovery protocol targeting specific aches and pains.

> **Role (Role):** You are a specialized sports rehabilitation therapist managing elite marathon runners.
>
> **Context (Context):**
>
> - Background: I just finished a `[5km / 10km / Half-Marathon]` run. My pace was `[6:30 / min/km]`.
> - Current Condition: I am feeling more tension than usual in my `[outer right knee / left sole / lower back]`.
> - Available Gear: I have a `[foam roller / massage gun / yoga strap]` at home.
>
> **Task (Task):**
>
> 1. Design a **10-minute targeted cool-down routine** tailored to prevent injury and rapidly flush out fatigue.
> 2. Clearly separate the routine into two phases: "Standing Stretches (Immediately post-run outside)" and "Floor/Mat Stretches (At home)".
> 3. Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for soothing the specific pain point (`[outer right knee]`), incorporating the available gear.
> 4. Specify the exact duration (in seconds) or breath count for each movement.
>
> **Constraints (Constraints):**
>
> - Avoid overly dense anatomical jargon; explain the biomechanics and posture in simple, accessible terms.
> - Explicitly include breathing cues (e.g., "inhale on the stretch, exhale on the release").
>
> **Warning (Warning):**
>
> - If my described symptom sounds like a severe acute injury (e.g., sharp, stabbing pain), do not attempt to diagnose it or offer a stretch. Advise consulting a medical professional immediately.

## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

This prompt is an absolute game-changer because it forces the AI to transition from regurgitating generic "PE class stretches" to acting as your bespoke sports therapist. By explicitly providing your pace, distance, and specific tight areas, the AI understands the exact biomechanical load your body just endured. The inclusion of the "Available Gear" variable is particularly powerful—it ensures the AI doesn't recommend foam rolling techniques if you only have a massage gun on hand. Be as specific as possible about _where_ you feel the tightness; the AI's ability to isolate the IT band, soleus, or piriformis muscle based on simple descriptions is remarkably accurate.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Do I need a paid AI subscription (like ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro) for this to work?**
  - A: Not at all! The Pro prompt is highly structured, so even free-tier models (like ChatGPT-3.5 or Gemini Flash) will follow the constraints perfectly and deliver an excellent, safe routine.

- **Q: Can I use this prompt for other sports, like cycling or weightlifting?**
  - A: Absolutely. Simply change the Context from a "run" to a "cycling session" or "squat day," and adjust your pain points. The AI will automatically adapt the biomechanical focus to suit the new sport.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** Casting the AI as an "elite marathon rehabilitation therapist" forces it to draw on professional sports science data rather than generic fitness blogs.
2. **Contextual Variables:** Brackets like `[5km / 10km]` and `[outer right knee]` allow the AI to calculate the expected physical toll and target its recovery advice with laser precision.
3. **Safety Constraints (Warning):** The explicit instruction to avoid medical diagnosis prevents the AI from giving dangerous stretching advice for what might actually be a torn ligament or stress fracture.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Generic Input)

```text
User: "Give me some stretches for after my run."

AI: "Here are some basic stretches! 1. Touch your toes. 2. Do some arm circles. 3. Jog in place..."
(A generic list of warm-ups that completely ignores the lower body impact of running.)
```

### ✅ After (Pro Version Input)

```text
**[10-Minute Elite Recovery Protocol]**

**Phase 1: Immediate Cool-Down (Standing / Outdoor)**

- **Dynamic Calf Stretch (Soleus Focus):** Find a curb or park bench. Place the ball of your foot on the edge and drop your heel.
  - *Breathing:* Inhale deeply, exhale as you let gravity gently pull the heel down. Hold for 30 seconds per leg.
- **Standing Quad Pull:** Grab your ankle and pull it toward your glutes. Keep your knees close together and push your hips slightly forward. (30 seconds per leg).

**Phase 2: Home Recovery (Focus on Outer Right Knee / IT Band)**

- **Targeted IT Band Roll (Using Foam Roller):** Lie on your side with the roller under your outer right thigh. Cross your top (left) leg over and plant your foot on the floor to absorb some of your body weight.
  - *Technique:* Slowly roll from just below the hip to just above the knee. If you find a tender "trigger point," hold the roller exactly there and take 5 deep breaths until the tension melts away.
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

If you want to keep running for years to come, you have to know how to stop properly. Stop skipping your cool-down just because you "don't know what to stretch." Let your personalized AI coach handle the recovery protocol, so you can focus on crushing your next personal record—completely injury-free.

Keep running, and stay healthy! 🏃‍♀️💨
