_"What was the email validation regex again... ah, how do I put hyphens in a phone number?"_

Regular Expressions (Regex), do they feel new every time you use them and like an alien language every time you see them?
`^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$`... Typing this yourself is torture.
Now, just say "Find an email format" in plain language.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Request complex pattern matching in natural language
2. Provide detailed explanations for the generated regex
3. Verify with test cases

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

**Pattern:** "The password must be at least 8 characters long and include at least one each of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters."

### ✅ After (Result)

**Regular Expression (JavaScript):**

```javascript
/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/;
```

**Explanation:**

- `^`: Start of string
- `(?=.*[a-z])`: Includes at least one lowercase letter
- `(?=.*[A-Z])`: Includes at least one uppercase letter
- `(?=.*\d)`: Includes at least one number
- `{8,}`: 8 or more characters

**Test:**

- ✅ `Pass1234!` (Match)
- ❌ `pass1234` (Missing special character/uppercase letter)
