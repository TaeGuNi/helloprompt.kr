_"I'm going to get 900 on TOIEC! (And then turns on Netflix)"_

The hardest part of studying alone is progress management. If you go to an academy, the teacher tells you "do this much", but self-study requires you to tell yourself. But the self inside me is too generous. This prompt hires a strict coordinator who gives you carrots and sticks.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Generates a customized roadmap considering goals, duration, and daily available study time.
2. Allocates specific daily workload (To-Do).
3. Warns of expected slump periods and suggests ways to overcome them.
