To be chosen by the YouTube algorithm, 'retention rate' is everything. A high-performing video requires a structure that throws a powerful hook right out of the gate, maintains absolute immersion throughout the main body, and finishes with a compelling call to action. Stop writing scripts from scratch and let AI apply this proven 'box office formula' to your ideas.

## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

This prompt is a game-changer because it shifts the AI's focus from merely "writing text" to "directing a viewer's attention." By explicitly demanding a strong 0~30 second hook and banning overused clichés, the AI stops writing like a generic essay bot and starts thinking like a retention-obsessed YouTube producer. When using this, pay close attention to the visual cues the AI suggests—often, a well-timed B-roll suggestion is what truly prevents a viewer from clicking away during a dry explanation.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well on the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, it works decently. However, for a truly nuanced tone and better pacing, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet or ChatGPT Plus (GPT-4o) yields significantly more natural, conversational scripts.

- **Q: Can I use this for short-form content like Shorts or Reels?**
  - A: You can, but Shorts require an even faster pace. If you are making Shorts, change the Hook constraint to "0~3 seconds" and remove the 3-part Main Body structure in favor of a single, rapid-fire narrative.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By setting the persona to an "Expert YouTube Producer," the AI adopts a professional, engaging tone focused on metrics (retention) rather than just information delivery.
2. **Pacing Constraints:** Explicitly breaking down the timeline (0~30 sec hook) forces the AI to front-load the value, directly countering the algorithm-killing slow intro.
3. **Cliché Ban:** Prohibiting phrases like "Let's dive right in" forces the AI to create unique, seamless transitions that keep the viewer immersed.
