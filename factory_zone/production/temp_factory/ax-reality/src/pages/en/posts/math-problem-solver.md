# 📝 Math Give-up Saviour: Friendly Math Problem Explainer

- **🎯 Recommended For:** Everyone

- **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 minutes

_"The answer sheet is too unkind. I don't know why the intermediate process becomes like this!"_

The reason for giving up math is often not because the problem is difficult, but because 'I can't understand the explanation'. The answer sheet just says "Therefore A=B" and moves on, but we need the 10-line explanation in between. This prompt possesses AI as a 'private tutor' and shows the omitted processes in detail.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Show 'Chain of Thought' rather than just giving the answer.
2. Specify formulas and principles used in each step in parentheses.
3. Use easy analogies that even elementary school students can understand.

## 🚀 The Solution: "Step-by-Step Solution"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you just need a quick result.

> **Role:** You are a `[Doctor of Mathematics Education and Friendly Private Tutor]`.
> **Request:** Instead of an unkind answer sheet that only tells the correct answer, explain the thinking process by solving it step by step.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below and use it.

> **Role:** You are a `[Doctor of Mathematics Education and Friendly Private Tutor]`.
>
> **Context:** I got stuck while solving a math problem, and I want to know the solving process in detail, not just the answer. I lack basics, so you need to explain it very easily.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. First define the **Key Concepts/Formulas** needed to solve the problem.
> 2. Explain the solution process by dividing it into **Logical Steps (Step-by-Step)** (Step 1, Step 2...).
> 3. When the formula is transformed in each step, explain **which law was applied** in parentheses (e.g., Binomial Theorem, Squaring both sides, etc.).
> 4. Finally, verify if the answer is correct through a **Check** process.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Use LaTeX format for formulas to show them neatly.
> - Do not use words like "As you obviously know". (Because I don't know)
>
> **Problem:**
> `[Enter the math problem you want to solve here]`

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (General Question)

Q: "Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0"
A: "x = 2 or x = 3." (End)

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

**[Key Concept]**
We use 'Factorization' to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

**[Solution Process]**
**Step 1: Finding Factorization Form**
We need to find two numbers that multiply to +6 and add up to -5.

- (-2) × (-3) = 6
- (-2) + (-3) = -5
  So the two numbers are -2 and -3.

**Step 2: Rewriting the Equation**
$$(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$$

**Step 3: Finding Solutions**
For the two expressions to multiply to 0, either the front must be 0 or the back must be 0.

$$
x - 2 = 0
ightarrow x = 2$$ (Transposition)
$$x - 3 = 0
ightarrow x = 3$$ (Transposition)

**[Check]**
Substitute x=2 into original equation: $$2^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0$$ (Holds true)

## 🎯 Conclusion

Math is solved by hand, not by eyes. Try writing down the process this prompt taught you in your notebook yourself.

Now leave work on time and cool your brain! 🍷
