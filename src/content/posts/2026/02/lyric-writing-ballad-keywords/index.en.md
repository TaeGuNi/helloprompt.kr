## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly effective because it forces the AI to focus on **imagery (the 3 keywords)** rather than abstract concepts. Novice songwriters often tell the AI to "write a sad song," resulting in generic, melodramatic lyrics. By providing specific, tangible objects (like an "old sofa" or "missed calls"), you anchor the AI's creativity in reality, producing lyrics that evoke genuine empathy.
_Pro Tip: Try using seemingly unrelated keywords (e.g., 'Coffee', 'Ticket', 'Dust') to spark highly unique and memorable verses!_

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with English lyrics, or is it better for other languages?**
  - A: It works exceptionally well in English! In fact, AI models are often better at recognizing English rhyme schemes (AABB, ABAB) and meter. Just specify the desired rhyme scheme in the constraints for even better results.

- **Q: The AI's lyrics have too many syllables to fit my melody. What should I do?**
  - A: You can add a specific constraint like "Keep each line under 8 syllables" or simply reply to the AI with, "Make the Chorus more concise, with shorter breaths."

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the persona of a "top-tier lyricist," the AI immediately elevates its vocabulary from conversational to poetic.
2. **Structural Constraints:** Forcing a specific structure (Verse - Pre-Chorus - Chorus) ensures the output is a functional song, not just a random poem.
3. **Cliche Avoidance:** The explicit constraint to avoid obvious phrases ("I love you", "sad") is the secret sauce that forces the AI to rely on metaphors and "show, don't tell" storytelling.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Simple Keyword Input)

```text
The old sofa is empty,
The sound of rain is loud,
I look at the missed calls,
I miss you so much.
```

### ✅ After (Using Pro Prompt)

```text
**[Verse 1]**
On this old sofa we picked out together,
Sitting alone, I feel the fabric wearing thin.
The sound of rain leaking through the window pane,
Sounds just like your nagging, so I cover my ears again.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
The shadows stretch across the empty floor,
Waiting for a knock that won't come anymore.

**[Chorus]**
In the glow of missed calls that never ring,
The words I couldn't say are piling up within.
Three letters of your name I still haven't erased,
Why does the silence carry such a heavy weight today?
```
