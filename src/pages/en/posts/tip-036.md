_"A function that refunds remaining points when a user withdraws... what should I name it? refundUser? returnPoint?"_

They say the two hardest things in computer science are 'cache invalidation' and 'naming things'.
Konglish variable names confuse foreign colleagues, and ambiguous names anger your future self.
Just explain the situation. We extract 5 stylish names used by native developers.
