Beyond AI generating text and images, we have now entered the era where AI generates **User Interfaces (UI)** in real-time. This is called **Generative UI**.

Today, we will explore **Tambo SDK**, a tool that helps you implement Generative UI most easily in a React environment, and build a simple example.

## What is Generative UI?

Traditional UI development involved developers defining all screens and components in advance and using conditional rendering based on data. Generative UI is different.

*   **Dynamic Generation:** AI decides and renders the most appropriate UI components on the fly based on user intent or conversation context.
*   **Personalization:** It can provide completely different custom interfaces for each user or situation.
*   **Flexibility:** It can handle undefined scenarios based on AI judgment.

## Why Tambo?

Tambo is an SDK that allows you to integrate this Generative UI into your application immediately without complex configuration.

1.  **React Friendly:** Perfectly compatible with the React component system.
2.  **Type Safety:** Built-in TypeScript support for safe development.
3.  **Easy Integration:** Easily integrates with major AI libraries like Vercel AI SDK.

## Getting Started with Tambo SDK

Imagine building a simple travel planning assistant chatbot. When a user says "Plan a trip to Jeju Island," instead of just replying with text, you want to show rich UI like **maps, flight booking cards, and hotel lists**.

### 1. Installation

First, install the package.

```bash
npm install @tambo/sdk ai
```

### 2. Define Components

Define the UI components that the AI can use. For example, a card component to show recommended places.

```tsx
// components/PlaceCard.tsx
import { Card, Text, Button } from '@tambo/ui';

export function PlaceCard({ name, description, rating }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Text size="lg" weight="bold">{name}</Text>
      <Text>⭐ {rating}</Text>
      <Text>{description}</Text>
      <Button>Book Now</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### 3. Configure Tambo Registry

Now you need to tell the AI about this component as a "Tool". Tambo makes this process very intuitive.

```tsx
// lib/tambo.ts
import { createTambo } from '@tambo/sdk';
import { PlaceCard } from '../components/PlaceCard';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const tambo = createTambo({
  components: {
    showPlace: {
      component: PlaceCard,
      description: 'Displays information about a place in a card format.',
      schema: z.object({
        name: z.string().describe('Name of the place'),
        description: z.string().describe('Description of the place'),
        rating: z.number().describe('Rating (1-5)'),
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

### 4. Rendering UI from AI Response

Finally, use Tambo in your chatbot interface to convert the AI's response into UI.

```tsx
// app/chat/page.tsx
import { useChat } from 'ai/react';
import { TamboProvider, GenerativeUI } from '@tambo/sdk/react';
import { tambo } from '@/lib/tambo';

export default function ChatPage() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

  return (
    <TamboProvider registry={tambo}>
      <div className="chat-container">
        {messages.map((m) => (
          <div key={m.id}>
            <strong>{m.role}:</strong>
            {/* Generated UI is rendered here alongside text messages */}
            <GenerativeUI content={m.content} />
          </div>
        ))}
        
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
          <button>Send</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

With Tambo SDK, you can let AI freely manipulate your React components without complex logic. The chat window is no longer just a space for text. Bring your app's features into the conversation now.
