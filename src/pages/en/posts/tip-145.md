_"I worked hard, but why does it look so trivial when I write it down?"_

My experiences are gems, but my writing is a stone. Recruiters scan resumes in 3 seconds. To survive in that short time, you need **'S.T.A.R' storytelling**. Let's change plain experience descriptions into professional achievements with AI.

1. Input plain work experience descriptions.
2. AI rewrites in S.T.A.R (Situation-Task-Action-Result) format.
