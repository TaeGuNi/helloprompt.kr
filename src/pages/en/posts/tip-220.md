_"Thinking they will raise it on their own... and it's been frozen for 3 years?"_

Companies don't give more money first to employees who stay still. A salary raise is not 'begging' but a legitimate **'Performance Report'**. Send an email persuading with facts, not emotions, to make an excuse to have coffee with the team leader.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Quantify and organize key achievements of the past year.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Emotional Appeal)

"Team leader, I'm working really hard these days, can't you raise my salary a bit?
Minsu next door got a raise this time..." (Worst comparison)
```

### ✅ After (Logical Persuasion)

```text
Title: [Request for Performance Review] Request for interview regarding 2025 first half work performance and salary adjustment

Hello Team Leader.

It was a rewarding time leading [Project A] for the past year and driving 150% growth compared to the previous year.
Ahead of the upcoming salary contract renewal, I would like to look back on past achievements and discuss treatment adjustments that align with next year's goals.

I would like to ask if a meeting for about 30 minutes would be possible at your convenience next week.
```
