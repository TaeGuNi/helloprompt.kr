macOS Tahoe introduced a new window management system that has sparked quite a debate.

While some users find the new resizing behaviors intuitive and "snappy", many others are reporting bugs or finding that it conflicts heavily with years of muscle memory.

It seems the transition isn't as smooth as Apple hoped. Is it a feature or a flaw?

**The saga continues.**
