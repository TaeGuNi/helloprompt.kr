## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Diary)

"It rained, so I was depressed. Want to eat pajeon."

### ✅ After (Essay Conversion)

**Title: On a Rainy Day, Even the Heart Needs a Pancake**

There are days when the sound of rain hitting the window feels unusually heavy. When the sky frowns, strangely, my heart sags like a damp cotton quilt. (...omitted...)
Depression might be a signal of hunger sent by the heart. If a savory pajeon can comfort me, isn't this rain quite a decent guest?

## 🎯 Conclusion

Your ordinary day was actually excellent writing material. Now, take that diary out of the drawer and into the world. 📖
