_"Are YouTube meditation videos too long and boring? Create a 3-minute meditation script that perfectly fits your mood right now."_

Many people know meditation is good, but find sitting still a torture. The important thing is not 'length' but 'immersion'. Explain your situation to AI and get a guide script that will lead you calmly. (Even better if read with TTS!)

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input current situation (way to work, before bed, etc.) and desired atmosphere.
2. Generate customized scripts including breathing induction to visualization.
3. Read or record the text to utilize as your own meditation guide.
