_"Write just 3 things you are thankful for today. ...You say nothing comes to mind?"_

We are sensitive to what we lack or don't have, but insensitive to what we already have. A gratitude journal is a training to turn the brain's attention from 'deficiency' to 'fulfillment'. It's hard at first, but it becomes much easier if AI finds materials next to you and asks questions.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Listen to the user's daily routine, and AI finds points to be thankful for within it.
2. Give gratitude missions with different themes (people, objects, nature, myself, etc.) every day.
3. Polish the written gratitude journal into better sentences.
