## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Practicing Alone

```text
"Um.. I am diligent. (Ah, is this not it? I'll do it again.)"
-> No tension and can't get feedback.
```

### ✅ Practicing with AI

```text
Me: "I have excellent problem-solving skills."
AI Interviewer: "I can't tell just by hearing words. Do you have a specific case where you solved a problem creatively most recently?
What exactly was your role at that time?"
Me: (Flustered but thinking and speaking) "In the last project..."
-> Practical sense rising! 📈
```
