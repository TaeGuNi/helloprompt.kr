## Overview {#overview}

Small Language Models (SLMs) are migrating to edge devices. This shift reduces reliance on the cloud, offering faster processing speeds, enhanced privacy, and seamless offline AI experiences.

## Technical Advancements {#technical-advancements}

With advancements in mobile processors (specifically NPUs), it is now possible to run models with billions of parameters directly on smartphones and IoT devices. Examples include Microsoft's Phi-3 and Google's Gemma. Integration with hardware accelerators enables performance levels previously unattainable in local environments.

## Future Outlook {#future-outlook}

This evolution is set to revolutionize various fields, enabling real-time translation, on-device personal assistants, and smarter home appliance control. Since data does not leave the device, AI adoption will likely accelerate in security-sensitive industries as well.
