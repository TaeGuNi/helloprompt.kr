_"Do you have any questions?"_

This isn't just a question, it's an **opportunity**. If you ask about salary or benefits here (while important), you drift further away from "hired". Throw a decisive punch that leaves the impression on the interviewer's brain: "This person is serious about our company."

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Create questions based on the company's recent news or issues.
2. Ask about the specific scope of work or team atmosphere for the job.
3. Build rapport by asking about the interviewer's personal experiences or thoughts.
