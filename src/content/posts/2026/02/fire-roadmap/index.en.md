> _"If you want to escape the 9-to-5 by your 40s, exactly how much do you need to start saving today?"_

Have you heard of the '4% Rule', the core principle of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement? It's the theory that if you invest your retirement funds in a diversified portfolio (like US index funds) and withdraw just 4% annually, your nest egg can sustain you indefinitely without depleting the principal. This prompt acts as your personal financial planner, pinpointing the exact year you can confidently hand in your resignation letter based on your current savings rate.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Determine your FIRE Number by multiplying your annual living expenses by 25.

## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

This prompt transforms overwhelming financial math into an actionable, highly motivating roadmap. The true power of this specific prompt lies in the **"Acceleration Simulation" (Task 3)**. By asking the AI to show the impact of just a slight increase in monthly savings, it changes your mindset from "retirement is decades away" to "if I skip a few luxury purchases a month, I buy back two full years of my life."

Furthermore, including the **Sequence of Returns Risk** ensures the AI doesn't just give you a fantasy number, but provides a realistic, bulletproof strategy that accounts for potential market downturns right after you officially retire.

---

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this account for inflation?**
  - A: Yes! In the Pro Version, the constraints explicitly instruct the AI to calculate your trajectory using a "real return rate" (expected return minus inflation), giving you a much more accurate timeline based on future purchasing power.

- **Q: Can I use this if I have debt?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just subtract your total debt from your "Current Net Worth/Investments" variable. If the number is negative, the AI will factor in your debt payoff period before calculating your wealth accumulation.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Explicit Variable Mapping:** By breaking down age, expenses, net worth, and savings into clear bullet points, the AI doesn't have to guess your financial state and avoids hallucinating numbers.
2. **Realistic Constraints:** Forcing the AI to use a 5% real return (8% market return - 3% inflation) ensures the projection is conservative and grounded in reality, rather than overly optimistic.
3. **Risk Awareness:** Prompting the AI to address the "Sequence of Returns Risk" adds a layer of professional financial advisory, ensuring you don't retire blindly into a bear market.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Simple Input)

```text
When can I retire? I am 32 and save $30,000 a year.
```

### ✅ After (Using the Pro Prompt)

```text
### 🔥 Your FIRE Movement Roadmap

**1. Target Asset Goal (FIRE Number)**
- Annual Expenses ($36,000) × 25 = **$900,000**

**2. Retirement Timeline Simulation**
- At your current savings rate and a 5% real return: **You will reach your goal in approximately 14 years (Age 46).**
- This is the inflection point where your compounding interest combined with your contributions hits the $900k mark.

**3. Acceleration Strategy (Adding $500/month)**
- Increasing your savings to $3,000/month shortens your timeline by **2 full years, allowing you to retire at age 44**.
- That extra $500 a month literally buys you two years of freedom!

**⚠️ Caution: Sequence of Returns Risk**
If the stock market crashes within the first 5 years of your retirement, withdrawing 4% can rapidly deplete your portfolio. **Strategy:** Build a "cash buffer" of 1 to 2 years' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account before you officially retire, so you don't have to sell stocks during a market dip.
