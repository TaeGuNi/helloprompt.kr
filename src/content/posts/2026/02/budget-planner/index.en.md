## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly effective because it forces the AI to adopt a "Save First, Spend Later" methodology. By isolating your savings goal as a non-negotiable fixed expense upfront, it completely removes the psychological burden of "trying to have money left over at the end of the month."

I highly recommend running this prompt whenever your fixed expenses change (e.g., a rent increase) or when you get a raise. It's particularly useful if you frequently overspend on food delivery; seeing the exact daily allowance you have remaining for variable expenses provides a massive reality check. If the AI suggests an impossibly low food budget to meet your savings goal, it's a clear indicator that you either need to reduce your fixed expenses or adjust your savings expectations.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work with different currencies like EUR, GBP, or KRW?**
  - A: Absolutely. The AI is excellent at understanding context. Just replace the dollar amounts with your local currency, and it will adjust its reasoning accordingly.

- **Q: What if my income fluctuates every month (e.g., freelancers)?**
  - A: For variable income, input your _lowest expected_ monthly net income. This ensures your baseline budget and savings goals are met even during slow months.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Concrete Financial Context:** By explicitly providing income, fixed costs, and a non-negotiable savings goal, we constrain the AI's math, preventing it from generating generic, unhelpful advice.
2. **Realistic Constraints:** The instruction to "ensure the food allowance is practical" prevents the AI from suggesting extreme frugality (like a $50 monthly grocery budget), which is the #1 reason budgeting attempts fail.
3. **Structured Output:** Demanding a Markdown table ensures you get a clean, screenshot-ready breakdown that you can easily copy into Notion or Excel.
