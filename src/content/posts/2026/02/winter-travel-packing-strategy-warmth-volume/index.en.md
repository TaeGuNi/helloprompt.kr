## 💡 Writer's Insight

Mastering the art of winter packing is less about the size of your suitcase and more about the strategic choice of materials. The core principle this prompt utilizes is the "onion routing" of clothing—layering. By instructing the AI to focus on high-performance base layers (like merino wool or Heattech) and windproof outer shells, you completely bypass the amateur mistake of packing multiple chunky knit sweaters. Furthermore, explicitly telling the AI to factor in wearing your bulkiest items on the plane is a game-changer that instantly frees up 30% of your luggage space. Use this prompt to transform a chaotic packing experience into a precise, space-saving operation.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Won't compression bags ruin my down jackets or sleeping bags?**
  - A: Prolonged compression can damage the loft (fluffiness) of down feathers. It is generally safe for the duration of a flight, but you must unpack and vigorously shake out your down gear immediately upon arrival to restore its insulating properties.
- **Q: Does this prompt work for extreme cold environments (e.g., -20°C)?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just ensure you input the exact `[Temperature]` in the Context section. The AI will automatically shift its recommendations from standard winter wear to specialized extreme-cold gear like heavy-duty thermal base layers and insulated shell pants.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Strategic Constraints:** By explicitly stating "Assume my bulkiest outerwear will be worn during transit," the AI avoids wasting space in its packing list recommendations.
2. **Contextual Awareness:** Factoring in "strong indoor heating" forces the AI to build a versatile, layer-based wardrobe rather than suggesting a single, unbreathable heavy layer that will make you sweat indoors.
3. **Targeted Recommendations:** Asking for "3 small but mighty essentials" extracts high-value, niche advice (like merino wool liners or specialized heat packs) instead of generic packing tips.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
Tell me what to prepare for a winter trip to Sapporo.
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
Based on your trip to Sapporo in February (Average Temp: -3°C) and your preference for traveling light:

**1. The 'No-Bulk' Layering System:**
*   **Base:** 2x Merino wool long-sleeve tops (odor-resistant, ultra-warm).
*   **Mid:** 1x Packable ultra-light down vest (core warmth without sleeve bulk).
*   **Outer:** Your main windproof/waterproof parka (worn on the plane).

**2. Space-Saving Packing Strategy:**
*   **Roll, Don't Fold:** Tightly roll all base layers and socks, stuffing them inside your packed shoes to maintain shoe shape and save space.
*   **Vacuum Compression:** Use travel vacuum bags specifically for your mid-layers and fleece items.

**3. Small but Mighty Essentials:**
*   **Attachable Heat Packs (Kairo):** Perfect for placing on your lower back or inside pockets.
*   **Touchscreen Glove Liners:** Wear these under thicker mittens so you don't freeze your hands while taking photos.
*   **Attachable Snow Spikes (Crampons):** Sapporo streets get extremely icy; these take up zero space but prevent serious falls.
