Hand over simple repetitive tasks to the machine.

### ❌ Before (Input: Messy Conversation)

What happens if you input a **"Stream of Consciousness"** conversation like below?

```text
Manager Kim: Hey, did you check the Seongsu-dong spot for the pop-up store this week?
Assistant Lee: Ah, they said it's full there... Hongdae is possible but expensive.
Manager Kim: Then check Hongdae for now and replan the budget. Oh right, did you fix the homepage banner text?
Staff Park: Ah, that's not yet... The design team is busy so they said they'll give it by tomorrow.
Manager Kim: It must be up by tomorrow. Park, you take care of it.
```

### ✅ After (Result: Perfect Report)

The AI analyzes this conversation and completes the report **in just 10 seconds**.

While you spend time reading and drawing tables one by one, the AI has already finished preparing to leave work.
