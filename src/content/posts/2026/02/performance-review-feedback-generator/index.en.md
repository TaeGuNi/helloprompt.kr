Writing performance evaluations is a delicate balancing act. You need to be fair, provide specific and actionable feedback, and avoid demoralizing your team members. Crafting a message that checks all these boxes while maintaining a professional tone is incredibly time-consuming and emotionally draining.

## 🚀 The Solution: "The Feedback Coach"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you are short on time and need a solid starting point.

> **Role:** You are an expert Leadership and Executive Coach.
> **Task:** I need to write a performance review for my team member. Please take my rough notes and rewrite them into professional, constructive feedback.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need highly nuanced, empathetic, and actionable performance evaluations.

> **Role:** You are a senior Leadership Coach and HR Expert specializing in constructive employee development.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: It is the annual performance review period. I need to write an evaluation for my team member, `[Employee Name]`.
> - Major Achievement: `[Key Success or Project]`
> - Area for Improvement: `[Specific Shortcoming or Mistake]`
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Write an evaluation that thoroughly acknowledges and praises their specific achievements.
> 2. Reframe the area for improvement as "Constructive Feedback" focused on future growth, avoiding a critical or accusatory tone.
> 3. Provide 2-3 specific, actionable expectations or goals for the next quarter based on the feedback.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Strictly use the "Sandwich Method" (Praise → Area for Improvement → Encouragement).
> - Use objective, fact-based language rather than vague adjectives (e.g., instead of "worked hard," use "delivered the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule").
> - Keep the tone professional, empathetic, and motivating.
> - Output the final evaluation in a clear, easy-to-read markdown format.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

As a manager, I used to dread review season. I'd spend hours agonizing over how to point out a team member's flaws without ruining their motivation. This prompt completely changed my workflow. By framing the AI as a "Leadership Coach," it naturally filters out emotional bias and bluntness, replacing it with objective, growth-oriented language.

**Pro Tip:** This prompt is especially effective when dealing with low-performing employees. It helps you deliver necessary hard truths in a palatable, professional wrapper, significantly reducing the chances of a defensive reaction during your 1-on-1 meetings.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well on the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, the free version (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4o-mini) handles this perfectly. However, models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4 tend to capture a more natural, empathetic human tone, which is ideal for sensitive HR matters.

- **Q: What if the AI's feedback sounds too generic or robotic?**
  - A: This usually happens when your `[Key Success]` or `[Area for Improvement]` inputs are too vague. Try adding specific metrics or incidents to your input (e.g., "Increased sales by 15%" instead of "Did well in sales").

- **Q: Can I use this for peer reviews as well?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just change the **Role** to "Supportive Colleague" and adjust the context to reflect peer-to-peer feedback rather than a top-down evaluation.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing (Leadership Coach & HR Expert):** Forces the AI to adopt a highly professional, tactful, and developmentally-focused tone.
2. **Structured Output (Sandwich Method constraint):** Ensures the feedback is psychologically safe to receive by cushioning the critique between positive reinforcement.
3. **Fact-Based Constraint:** Prevents the AI from generating fluffy, meaningless praise or vague criticism, ensuring the evaluation holds actual weight and value for the employee's growth.
