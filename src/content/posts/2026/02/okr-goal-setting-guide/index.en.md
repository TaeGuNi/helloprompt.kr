Use this when you need a fast, solid baseline for your OKRs.

> **Role:** You are an expert OKR Coach from Google.
> **Request:** I need to establish an inspiring Objective and 3 measurable Key Results for my `[Insert Team/Project Name]`. The main goal is to `[Insert High-Level Goal]`.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need highly detailed, professional-grade OKRs tailored to your specific organizational context.

> - Our most critical mission this quarter is `[e.g., successfully launching our new enterprise tier]`.
>
> **Task (Instructions):**
>
> 1. Suggest 3 inspiring, qualitative, and challenging Objectives that will motivate the team.
> 2. For each Objective, provide 3 specific, measurable, and time-bound Key Results (KRs).
> 3. Clearly specify the exact metrics, numbers, or KPIs used to measure the success of each KR.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Drafting OKRs from scratch often leads to "analysis paralysis," where teams spend weeks debating wording instead of executing. The real magic of this prompt is how it strictly enforces the fundamental rule of OKRs: **Objectives must inspire, and Key Results must measure.** By explicitly separating the qualitative ambition from the quantitative metrics in the prompt's constraints, the AI prevents you from creating hybrid, confusing goals like "Improve UX by 20%." I highly recommend running this prompt collaboratively with your team during quarterly planning to brainstorm and refine your goals together.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, the basic version works perfectly on free models. However, for the Pro Version—which involves strict constraints and persona adoption—I strongly recommend using GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced to ensure the nuances of the OKR framework are perfectly captured.

- **Q: Can the AI help me track these OKRs over the quarter?**
  - A: Absolutely. Once you establish your OKRs using this prompt, you can periodically feed your weekly progress data back to the AI and ask, "Based on these KRs, are we on track? What potential roadblocks should we address this week?"

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the persona of a "Google OKR Coach," the AI adopts the precise methodology and high standards pioneered by companies that successfully use OKRs.
2. **Clear Constraints:** Explicitly defining that Objectives are qualitative and KRs are quantitative eliminates the most common mistake beginners make when setting OKRs.
3. **Contextual Grounding:** Providing the team's role and quarterly mission ensures the output is highly relevant and immediately actionable, rather than generic business advice.
