## 💡 Writer's Insight

Cultural faux pas rarely happen out of malice; they happen out of ignorance. While a simple Google search might tell you "Japanese people bow," it won't tell you _how deep_ to bow to a CEO versus a junior manager, or how to seamlessly transition from a bow to a Western handshake.

This prompt is invaluable because it contextualizes the advice. By inputting the specific _Meeting Purpose_ and the _Counterpart's Seniority_, the AI tailors its response. For instance, the etiquette for an introductory networking coffee in Germany is vastly different from a final contract signing with a German Board of Directors. Always run this prompt 48 hours before your flight to mentally prepare your "cultural script."

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can't I just act professionally according to Western standards?**
  - A: Not always. In many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures, forcing a strictly Western "direct and assertive" business style can come off as aggressive or disrespectful. Adapting to their norms shows respect and immediately builds goodwill.

- **Q: What if the AI gives me conflicting advice compared to what a colleague told me?**
  - A: Trust, but verify. AI is excellent at aggregating general cultural norms, but corporate cultures can vary. If your colleague has direct experience with that _specific company_, their hyper-local knowledge might trump general national etiquette.

- **Q: How does this help with virtual meetings (Zoom/Teams)?**
  - A: You can easily modify the prompt! Just change the context to: `Meeting Purpose: Initial Zoom Call`. The AI will then focus on virtual etiquette, such as background expectations, whether small talk is expected before diving into the agenda, and turn-taking in conversation.

## 🧬 Prompt Dissection (Why it works?)

1.  **Granular Context (`Meeting Purpose` & `Seniority`):** Business manners scale with hierarchy. The prompt forces the AI to provide rank-appropriate advice, which is where most generic searches fail.
2.  **Specific Output Structuring (`Task 1-4`):** By breaking the request into chronological phases (Greeting -> Icebreaking -> Meeting -> Dining), it creates a mental roadmap that is easy for the user to memorize and execute.
3.  **Risk Mitigation (`Constraints` & `Warning`):** Explicitly asking for taboos and forbidding historical stereotypes ensures the advice is safe, modern, and practically applicable today.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Basic Input)

> "Tell me about Chinese business manners."

_(Result: A generic wall of text about Confucianism, face (mianzi), and basic facts that are too broad to be actionable right before a meeting.)_

### ✅ After (Using the Pro Prompt)

_(Result: Highly structured, actionable directives.)_

> **Greetings:** Wait for the senior host to initiate the handshake. Handshakes should be gentle, not a firm Western grip.
> **Business Cards:** _Crucial._ Present and receive business cards with **both hands**. Take 3-5 seconds to actively read the card before placing it respectfully on the table. Never shove it directly into your pocket.
> **Gifting Taboos:** Never gift clocks, umbrellas, or sharp objects, as they symbolize death, separation, or severing ties. Wrap gifts in red or gold; avoid white or black.
> **Dining:** If invited to a banquet, be prepared for toasts (_Ganbei_). It is polite to leave a small amount of food on your plate to signal the host has provided abundantly.
