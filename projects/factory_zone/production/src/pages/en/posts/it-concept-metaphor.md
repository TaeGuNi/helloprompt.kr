# 📝 If API is Compared to a Restaurant? Coding Concept Metaphor Vending Machine

**🎯 Recommended For:** Everyone

- **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 minutes
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** All AI Models

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility  |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
|  ⭐⭐☆☆☆   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ |

_"What exactly does it mean that the server is down?"_
_"API integration? What is that to take 2 weeks?"_

Development terms are like alien language. Looking at dictionary definitions doesn't make sense. In this case, 'Analogy' is the medicine. If you substitute it into a familiar situation, complex technology is understood at once. This prompt interprets rigid IT terms into soft everyday language.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Compare difficult IT terms to user-specified situations (Restaurant, Library, Soccer team, etc.)
2. 1:1 Matching (Mapping) of elements in metaphor and actual technology elements
3. Prevent misconceptions by pointing out limitations (precautions) of metaphor

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Dictionary Definition)

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: Interface made to control functions provided by operating system or programming language so that application programs can use them... (Sleepy)

### ✅ After (Prompt Result: Restaurant Metaphor)

**[Situation Metaphor]**
API is **'Restaurant Waiter (Clerk)'**.
Customer (You) doesn't shout "Give me pasta" directly to the Chef (Server), right?
Instead, you order looking at the Menu (Document) to the Waiter.
Then the Waiter takes the order sheet to the kitchen, receives the food, and brings it to you.
You don't need to know whether the kitchen is doing a fire show or chopping. Just call the Waiter.

**[1:1 Matching]**
| Restaurant Situation | IT Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Customer** | Client (User/App) |
| **Waiter** | **API** (Intermediary) |
| **Chef** | Server (Database) |
| **Menu** | API Document (User Manual) |
| **Dish** | Data (Response) |

**[One Sentence Summary]**
"Smart clerk running errands between two programs that don't speak the same language."

## 🎯 Conclusion

If you don't understand, you can't use it. Metaphor is a shortcut to understanding. Now don't be scared of developers and talk. "Ah, that waiter took the wrong order?"

Now leave work on time and go to a delicious restaurant and call the waiter... no, API! 🍷
