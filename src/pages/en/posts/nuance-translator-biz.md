# 🇺🇸 Translation Beyond Translator: Fixing 'Nuance'

**🎯 Recommended for:** Traders sweating over emails, PMs working with global devs

- **⏱️ Time Required:** 30 seconds
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** DeepL (Draft) + ChatGPT-4o (Nuance Polish)

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility   |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :--------: |
|   ⭐☆☆☆☆   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

_"Send me the file ASAP."_
(Literal: Send fast.)
(Native feel: **"Give it to me NOW or die."**)

Did you know your translator-generated email might sound rude? The core of Business English is not words, but **'Tone & Manner'**. Let's use AI to add the **'Politeness'** and **'Class'** that Papago or Google Translate miss.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1.  Write roughly in native language. ("Do this fast")
2.  Tell AI: **"Change to Business Tone."**
3.  AI gives you elegant phrases like "Could you possibly...".

## 🚀 Solution: "Nuance Polisher"

### 🥉 Basic Version (Make it Polite)

When rushing someone without offending.

> **Role:** You are a US Business Etiquette Expert.
> **Sentence:** `[Give me the report by tomorrow.]` (Too direct)
> **Request:** Change this to a **Polite & Professional** expression suitable for a boss or client. Give 3 versions.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Contextual Nuance)

Delicate situations like Rejection, Apology, Negotiation.

> **Role:** You are a Global Communication Consultant from Harvard MBA.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - **Recipient:** Overseas Partner (Friendly relation)
> - **Content:** Their proposal is good, but price is high. Want 10% discount.
> - **My Draft:** `Your proposal is good. But price is expensive. Discount 10% please.`
>
> **Task:**
> Rewrite my draft into a natural Business Email.
>
> **Conditions:**
>
> 1.  **Tone:** Gentle but Firm.
> 2.  **Strategy:** Acknowledge value (Sandwich technique), but use budget constraint to induce price cut.
> 3.  **Output:** Subject line and Body.

## 🧬 Anatomy of Prompt (Why it works?)

1.  **Sandwich Technique:** Instructing AI to wrap Refusal/Request (Meat) with Compliments (Bread). Success rate is much higher than just saying "Discount please".
2.  **Ask for 3 Options:** Good to have choices based on tone. (Casual / Formal / Urgent)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Konglish + Rude)

**Me:** "Please check attached file. If error, tell me."
**Receiver:** (What? Is this an order?)

### ✅ After (AI Polish)

**AI:** "Kindly review the attached file at your convenience. Should you identify any discrepancies, please do not hesitate to let me know."
**Receiver:** (Wow, educated person. I'll check right away.)

## 🎯 Conclusion

Not speaking English is not a sin, but **being rude is**.
Close your dictionary, ask AI.

"Does this sound... rude?"
It will be your best interpreter protecting your dignity. 🍷
