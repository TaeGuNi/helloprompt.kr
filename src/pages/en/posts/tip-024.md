_"If you're done with development, give me the documentation too. (Frontend Developer)"_
_"Ah... wait a minute. (Haven't written a single line yet)"_

Is it just me who hates writing documentation more than developing APIs?
You feel a sense of futility while writing down parameter types, requirements, and response examples one by one.
Now, just copy and paste the controller code. AI will convert it into a clean Swagger spec for you.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Extract accurate parameter/response specifications based on code
2. Automatically generate OpenAPI (Swagger) YAML/JSON formats
3. Include easy-to-understand explanations and example data

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Code - Node.js Express)

```javascript
app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  const { username, email } = req.body;
  if (!email) return res.status(400).send({ msg: "no email" });
  // DB saving logic...
  res.status(201).send({ id: 1, username, email });
});
```

### ✅ After (Result - Markdown Example)

### **POST /users**

User Signup API

**Request Body**
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `username` | String | Y | User nickname |
| `email` | String | Y | User email (Unique) |

**Response (201 Created)**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "jay_dev",
  "email": "jay@example.com"
}
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Documentation is not the end of development, but the beginning of collaboration.
But don't spend too much energy on that beginning. Leave it to AI and focus on business logic! 🍷
