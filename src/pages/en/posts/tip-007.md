_"If code you wrote 3 months ago looks like someone else wrote it? Variable names like a, b, c and triple nested for-loops... You need a savior."_

Dealing with legacy code is like bomb disposal. You're afraid it might explode if you touch it. Use AI to proceed with refactoring that maintains the logic while improving readability and efficiency.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Unreadable spaghetti code is the enemy of maintenance.
2. Assign the role of 'Clean Code Refiner' to AI to improve readability and performance simultaneously.
3. Transform it into code that teammates can easily understand with reasons for changes and friendly comments.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** below and paste it into ChatGPT or Claude.

> **Role:** You are a `[Clean Code Author-level Developer]`.
>
> **Context:** I have `[Language Name]` code that works but has poor readability and is inefficient.
>
> **Request:**
>
> 1. Refactor this code from the perspectives of 'readability' and 'performance'.
> 2. Change variable and function names to intuitive naming.
> 3. Explain the reason why the changed parts are better.

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input: Python Example)

```python
def c(l):
    r = 0
    for i in l:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            r += i
    return r
```

<br>

### ✅ After (Output)

```python
def calculate_even_sum(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates and returns the sum of even numbers in the given list of numbers.
    """
    # Filter only even numbers and calculate sum (Use List Comprehension for improved performance and readability)
    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)

# 💡 Reason for Change:
# 1. Naming: Changed function name c -> calculate_even_sum, variable l -> numbers, r -> sum to clarify intent.
# 2. Logic Simplification: Replaced for-loop and if-statement with sum() and generator expression for Pythonic code.
# 3. Type Hint Added: Specified input and output types to ensure stability.
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Good code is not code that computers understand, but code that 'humans' understand. Elevate the class of your code with AI.
