## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Recommend a locked-room murder trick."

### ✅ After (Result)

- **Culprit:** Maid
- **Trick:** Ice bullet? NO. Use **'Thermal Expansion'**. The victim was actually sniped from outside the window, not inside. The culprit loosened the window frame screws the day before and turned the heating to max, causing the frame to expand and jam tight (completing the locked room).
- **Alibi:** Was cooking in the 1st-floor kitchen at the estimated time of death. (But manipulated the actual time of death)
- **Clue:** The room is hot, but the victim is wearing a sweater. No condensation only around the window frame.
