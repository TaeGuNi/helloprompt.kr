<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need high-quality, logically sound narrative branches that respect your characters' established traits.

> **Role:** You are a bestselling web novel writer and a master plot consultant.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - I am currently writing a novel and have hit writer's block. I need help mapping out the next development.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Based on the `[Current Situation]` and `[Genre]` provided below, suggest 5 ingenious 'What If' scenarios to move the story forward.
> 2. Each scenario must feature a completely different atmosphere, pacing, and narrative mechanism.
> 3. For each scenario, provide a brief analysis of the 'Expected Reader Reaction' and the potential 'Narrative Risk' (e.g., probability or pacing issues).
>
> **Input Variables:**
>
> - **Genre:** `[e.g., Modern Fantasy, Romance Thriller]`
> - **Current Situation:** `[e.g., The protagonist finally corners the target of his revenge, only to discover it's his long-lost brother.]`
> - **Protagonist's Personality:** `[e.g., Cold-hearted, pragmatic, but secretly vulnerable when it comes to family.]`

## 💡 Writer's Insight

The true power of this prompt lies in the **'Expected Reader Reaction'** and **'Narrative Risk'** parameters. When we brainstorm alone, we often fall in love with a twist without considering if it makes logical sense within the world we've built. By forcing the AI to play devil's advocate and assess the "probability risk," you avoid writing yourself into a corner. I highly recommend running this prompt through Claude 3.5 Sonnet—it tends to have the most nuanced understanding of character psychology and genre tropes.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work for non-fiction or essay writing?**
  - A: It's heavily optimized for fiction. However, you can tweak the variables (e.g., changing "Protagonist's Personality" to "Target Audience") to brainstorm counter-arguments or unexpected angles for an essay.

- **Q: What if the AI suggests something that contradicts my earlier chapters?**
  - A: That's where the 'Context' section is vital. If you have hard rules in your universe (e.g., "Magic cannot revive the dead"), add them directly to the **Constraints** section before running the prompt.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** Casting the AI as a "bestselling web novel writer" forces it to prioritize pacing, reader engagement, and commercial viability over dry, academic storytelling.
2. **Variable Constraints:** By explicitly separating `[Genre]`, `[Current Situation]`, and `[Protagonist's Personality]`, the AI understands the exact boundaries it must operate within.
3. **Risk Assessment:** Asking the AI to evaluate the 'Narrative Risk' acts as a built-in quality control mechanism, preventing wildly out-of-character or nonsensical plot twists.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
The protagonist has cornered the villain in the alley, but doesn't actually want to kill him. How do I proceed without making the protagonist look weak? (Stuck for 3 days)
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
1. **[The Unholy Alliance]**: What if a drastically more powerful third-party threat drops into the alley, forcing the protagonist and the villain into a desperate, temporary truce?
   - Reader Reaction: Hype and tension. Enemies-to-allies is a beloved trope.
   - Risk: Might feel like a deus ex machina if the third party hasn't been foreshadowed.

2. **[The Misunderstanding]**: What if the villain immediately drops to their knees and swears loyalty, mistaking the protagonist for the legendary dark successor they've been searching for?
   - Reader Reaction: Intrigue and dark comedy.
   - Risk: Shifts the genre tone slightly towards satire; requires careful handling.

3. **[The Poisoned Chalice]**: What if the villain doesn't fight back, but instead offers the protagonist a USB drive containing the one secret that could destroy the protagonist's mentor?
   - Reader Reaction: Shock and moral conflict.
   - Risk: Slows down the immediate physical pacing in favor of psychological tension.
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

You don't have to shoulder the burden of creation entirely on your own. Think of AI as your tireless co-writer, always ready to bounce ideas around at 3 AM. The next time you hit a wall, don't force the words—just ask, "What If?"

Now, get back to writing that next chapter! ✍️🍷
