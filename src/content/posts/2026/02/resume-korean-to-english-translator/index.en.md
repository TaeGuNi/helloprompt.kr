# 📝 Prompt Changing Korean Resume to Native-Level English Resume

- **🎯 Recommended For:** Job seekers, professionals targeting global companies, anyone struggling with English resumes.
- **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 minutes
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** All AI Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

- ⭐ **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆
- ⚡️ **Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 🚀 **Utility:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

> _"A resume directly translated by a standard translation tool often screams 'Konglish' to a native recruiter. It's time to speak their language."_

English resumes follow entirely different rules than Korean ones. You must drop the subject ("I") and kick off every bullet point with a powerful **Action Verb**. Don't just ask AI to translate your text; commission it to be your expert Silicon Valley Resume Writer.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. **Input:** Paste your Korean resume or career history.
2. **Transform:** AI converts it into the standard Western resume format (omitting subjects, starting with action verbs).

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Direct translation tools like Google Translate or DeepL are great for general communication, but they fail spectacularly at resumes. Why? Because a resume isn't just about language; it's about _formatting conventions_. Western recruiters expect to see "Action-oriented bullet points."

By assigning the AI the persona of a "Silicon Valley Recruiter," you force it to look past the literal words and focus on the _impact_. This prompt is particularly effective because it explicitly instructs the AI to highlight numbers—which is the universal language of business success. If you find the AI's output is too "flowery" or complex, simply add a constraint: `"Keep the vocabulary concise and strictly business-professional."`

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, the Pro prompt provides enough context that even free models like GPT-3.5 or Claude 3 Haiku will produce excellent results. However, advanced models (GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) will provide slightly more natural industry jargon.

- **Q: What if I don't have exact numbers for my achievements?**
  - A: You should try to estimate them reasonably. If you absolutely cannot provide numbers, modify the prompt to focus on the _scope_ of the project or the _efficiency_ gained, rather than hard metrics.

- **Q: Should I use this for my Cover Letter too?**
  - A: Resumes and Cover Letters have different tones. For a Cover Letter, you _do_ use "I" and "My," and you write in full sentences. You will need a different prompt tailored specifically for Cover Letters.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Persona Assignment:** "Silicon Valley Recruiter" ensures the AI applies the highest standard of Western corporate expectations.
2. **Action Verb Mandate:** Forces the AI to abandon the passive, narrative style common in directly translated Korean resumes.
3. **Metric Emphasis:** Instructing the AI to bold numbers naturally draws the recruiter's eye to your actual impact.
