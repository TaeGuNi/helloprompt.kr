## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Code)

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero.");
  return a / b;
}
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```javascript
describe("divide function tests", () => {
  // 1. Normal behavior test
  test("10 divided by 2 should be 5", () => {
    expect(divide(10, 2)).toBe(5);
  });

  // 2. Exception handling test
  test("dividing by 0 should throw an error", () => {
    expect(() => divide(10, 0)).toThrow("Cannot divide by zero.");
  });

  // 3. Boundary/Special value test
  test("dividing negative numbers should result in a negative number", () => {
    expect(divide(-10, 2)).toBe(-5);
  });
});
```
