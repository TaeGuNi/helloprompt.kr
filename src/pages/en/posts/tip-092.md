_"Do you become mute after saying Excuse me...? Just take these 10 necessary phrases."_

Translation apps are great, but it's cumbersome to turn on, type, and show when in a hurry. Prepare the most used sentences in the travel destination as cards in advance. Locals will smile saying "Oh, you speak a little?".

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input travel country and worrying situations (immigration, ordering, etc.).
2. Generate key sentences with local pronunciation (Korean notation).
3. Complete conversation cards (Cheatsheet) that can be captured and used immediately.
