Modifiers like "Explain in detail" or "Tell me step-by-step" are no longer necessary. The core of the Prompt Engineering 3.0 era is not 'Syntax', but 'Intent'.

## The Evolution of Prompts

- **1.0**: Keyword-centric. Listing words like entering search terms.
- **2.0**: Structured instructions. Using complex templates like Role assignment and Constraints.
- **3.0**: Intent-centric. AI understands context and proposes the optimal result on its own.

## What is Intent-Based Prompting?

It's AI understanding perfectly even if the user speaks poorly. For example, if you just upload a file and type "Clean this up," the AI looks at the file format and decides whether to create a summary, organize data into a table, or proofread—or it asks for clarification.

### Practical Example

**Past (2.0):**
"You are a professional marketer. Write an Instagram promotional caption based on the product description below. Use emojis, include 5 hashtags, and keep the tone friendly."

**Present (3.0):**
(After uploading product photo) "For Insta promo."

With just this short input, the AI analyzes the mood of the image, infers the target audience, and generates the optimal copy.

## Skills We Need

Now, more important than the ability to 'write' prompts is the 'planning power' to decide what to ask AI and the 'discernment' to judge the output. As technical barriers lower, essential creativity will shine even brighter.
