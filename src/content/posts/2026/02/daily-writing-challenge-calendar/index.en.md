### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this prompt for a highly structured, scalable, and personalized editorial calendar.

> **Role:** You are a veteran writing coach and senior content curator.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: I am trying to build a consistent daily writing habit but struggle with idea generation.
> - Goal: I need a compelling 30-day topic calendar that keeps me motivated without feeling overwhelmed.
>
> **Input Information:**
>
> - **My Interests:** `[e.g., Startup Culture, Psychology, Productivity]`
> - **Writing Purpose:** `[e.g., To share personal insights and build a personal brand]`
> - **Target Audience:** `[e.g., Junior developers and ambitious professionals]`
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Create a **30-day writing schedule** presented in a Markdown table with columns: (Day | Topic | Guiding Question).
> 2. Structure the pacing: Start with light, easy-to-answer topics for Days 1-5 to build momentum, gradually introducing deeper, more reflective topics toward the end.
> 3. Incorporate a "Breather/Retrospective" topic once a week (e.g., Days 7, 14, 21, 28) to prevent burnout.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - The 'Guiding Question' must be highly specific and evocative. (Bad: "Write about your career." / Good: "What is a piece of career advice you received that sounded great but turned out to be terrible?")
> - Do not generate the actual articles; only provide the calendar.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a game-changer because it eliminates "decision fatigue." When you sit down to write, your cognitive energy should be spent on crafting sentences, not brainstorming topics. By incorporating "breather" days every week, the Pro Version mimics a realistic workout routine for your brain, significantly increasing the likelihood that you will actually complete the 30-day challenge. I've used this exact framework to build my own newsletter backlog!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well on free AI models like ChatGPT-3.5 or Gemini Flash?**
  - A: Absolutely. Because the prompt provides a strict structural framework, even lighter models excel at generating the calendar. However, more advanced models like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet tend to provide more creative and nuanced "Guiding Questions."

- **Q: Can I change the duration from 30 days to 100 days?**
  - A: Yes! Just change the number in the prompt. For longer challenges, I highly recommend adding a constraint like "Group the topics into weekly themes" to keep the calendar organized.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Strategic Pacing:** By explicitly instructing the AI to start easy and scale up the difficulty, the prompt prevents early burnout.
2. **Specific Constraints:** Forcing the AI to write specific, evocative guiding questions prevents generic, uninspiring prompts that lead to writer's block.
3. **Rest Intervals:** Scheduling "retrospective" days ensures the writing habit remains sustainable over a long period.
