_"That feeling of a forest inside a person's silhouette, how do I make it?"_

**Double Exposure** is an art technique born from the mistake of overlapping images by exposing a single film twice in the days of film cameras. It mainly expresses the inner world or harmony with nature by filling landscapes inside the silhouette of a figure.
