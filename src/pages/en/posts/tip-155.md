_"They say don't put all your eggs in one basket, but is your basket okay?"_

The standard of investment is asset allocation, but over time, specific assets become too large or small, breaking the balance. This prompt analyzes your current asset weightings, calculates the gap with target weightings, and tells you exactly "what and how much to sell and buy" down to the specific quantity.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Analyze weightings by asset class of current portfolio.
2. Calculate excess/deficiency by comparing with Target Weight.
3. Present concrete rebalancing action plan including buy/sell quantities.

### ⚖️ Portfolio Rebalancing Proposal

**1. Weighting Analysis**
| Asset Class | Current Amount | Current Weight | Target Weight | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stocks** | 75M | 75% | 60% | 🔻 15% (Over) |
| **Bonds** | 15M | 15% | 30% | 🔺 15% (Under) |
| **Cash** | 10M | 10% | 10% | ✅ Proper |

**2. Action Plan**
1. **[Sell]** Sell **15 million KRW** worth of Stock assets. (Profit taking)
2. **[Buy]** Buy additional **15 million KRW** worth of Bond assets with the secured cash.

**3. Expected Effect**
Reducing the stock weighting, which has become bloated due to price rise, lowers volatility risk, and has the effect of buying undervalued bonds at a low price.
