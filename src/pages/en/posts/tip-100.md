_"Did the whole week pass while just planning? We apply the immutable law of priorities filling in important things (Big Rock) first."_

The reason why you can't practice even if you write To-Do Lists is because there is no 'Time Allocation'. Hire an AI assistant to convert your to-do list into a timetable (Time blocking).

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Randomly list things to do this week (To-Do).
2. Classify priorities according to importance and urgency (Eisenhower Matrix).
3. Generate a Weekly Schedule considering realistic execution time.
