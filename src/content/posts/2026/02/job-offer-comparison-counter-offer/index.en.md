## 💡 Writer's Insight

Negotiating a job offer can feel intimidating, but it is standard business practice. HR departments and hiring managers actually expect candidates to negotiate. The key to a successful counter-offer is _leverage_ and _tone_. By using AI to draft your communication, you remove the emotion and anxiety from the process. This prompt ensures your email strikes the perfect balance between expressing genuine enthusiasm for the role and firmly holding your ground on compensation. Remember, the worst they can say is "no, this is our final offer," at which point you still have a great job lined up!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Is it risky to negotiate? Will they rescind the offer?**
  - A: It is incredibly rare for a company to pull an offer simply because you tried to negotiate professionally. As long as your tone is respectful and your request is reasonable (typically 5-10% above the initial offer), the worst outcome is usually just a polite decline.

- **Q: Should I tell my current employer about the external offers?**
  - A: Only if you are genuinely willing to walk away. Using an external offer to force a raise at your current job can damage trust. This prompt can help you weigh the risks of accepting a counter-offer from your current employer.

- **Q: Do I need the paid version of ChatGPT or Claude for this?**
  - A: No, the free versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are perfectly capable of analyzing these conditions and writing excellent negotiation emails.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** Assigning the AI the role of an "executive negotiation coach" forces it to use professional, persuasive, and tactful language.
2. **Contextual Clarity:** By clearly defining the pros and cons of each company, the AI can tailor its advice rather than giving generic negotiation tips.
3. **Behavioral Constraints:** The instruction to "not sound arrogant" is critical. It ensures the drafted email maintains goodwill, which is essential when negotiating with future colleagues.

```

### ✅ After (Attempting Counter Offer)

```text
"Thank you so much for the generous offer. Company A remains my top choice, and I am incredibly excited about the prospect of joining the team.

However, I am currently weighing another competitive offer that provides a slightly different compensation structure. If Company A is able to adjust the base salary to $65,000, I would be thrilled to accept and sign the offer immediately."
```
