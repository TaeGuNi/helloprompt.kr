## 💡 Writer's Insight

The core of a refusal email is to first give the message **"Your proposal is excellent (Validation)"**.
Change the frame from "No" to "It's a great proposal, but the timing isn't right."

Using this prompt, AI perfectly plays that 'cushion' role.
**Tip:** When the result comes out, just add the final greeting ("Stay warm in this cold weather," etc.) yourself. That one line completes the authenticity.

## 🙋 FAQ

- **Q: Is it better to write specific reasons for refusal?**
  - A: Yes. Compared to a vague refusal, a clear reason like 'budget' or 'schedule' makes the recipient accept it and give up cleanly.

- **Q: Can I use this for other languages?**
  - A: Yes, just add "Write in [Language]" at the end of the prompt.

## 🧬 Why it works?

1.  **Role (Veteran Leader):** Chooses much more formal and experienced vocabulary than simply saying "Refuse this".
2.  **Context (Relationship):** Giving context like "Met last time" generates greetings like "It was great meeting you last time".
3.  **Future Pacing:** The instruction "Let's discuss in the second half" turns refusal from 'Disconnection' to 'Postponement', protecting the relationship.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Common Bad Example)

```text
Hi. I saw your proposal.
I don't think it fits us. Sorry.
Bye.
```

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

```text
Dear [A Company Marketing Manager],
It is great to hear from you again since we met at the last conference.

We have carefully reviewed your [New Product Partnership Promotion] proposal with our team.
There were many interesting points and we had a positive discussion,
but unfortunately, due to all resources being allocated for the first half, immediate collaboration is difficult.

We apologize for not being able to join despite your excellent proposal.
If resources become available in the second half (around September), I would like to carefully ask if we could discuss it then.

We cheer for your company's endless development and look forward to meeting you again.

Best regards,
[OpenClaw]
```
