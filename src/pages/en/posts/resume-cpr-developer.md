# 🫀 Resume CPR: Proving 'Developer' Experience with Numbers

> **🎯 Recommended for:** Humble developers who write "I worked hard", Juniors tired of rejection
> **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 mins (Before/After is dramatic)
> **🤖 Recommended Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Excellent Writing)

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility   |

> (Recruiter: "So? Everyone does that.")

A developer's resume is not code. It's **'Business Impact'**. Even for the same work, how you phrase it changes your salary by $10k. Here is how to transform a boring resume into a **Number-driven Attractive Profile**.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1.  Find "Did" in your resume.
2.  Tell AI: "Change this to STAR method (Situation-Task-Action-Result)".
3.  Force it to include **Numbers (%)**.

## 🚀 Solution: "Resume Polish Prompt"

### 🥉 Basic Version (Refining Sentences)

When sentences are too long or boring.

> **Role:** You are a Recruiter at Big Tech.
> **Sentence:** `[I successfully finished the project with team members.]`
> **Request:** Change this to a more professional and specific expression.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (STAR Method Converter)

This is the real deal. Turns plain experience into 'Achievement'.

> **Role:** You are a Professional Resume Consultant for Google/Facebook candidates.
>
> **Input (My Experience):**
> `[Images on shopping mall were slow, so I improved loading speed. Added resizing and caching.]`
>
> **Task:**
> Reconstruct this into **STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**.
> And summarize into a one-line **Bullet Point**.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> 1.  **Quantification:** Result MUST have numbers (%, ms, sec). (If you don't know exact numbers, estimate 'approx XX% improvement')
> 2.  **Tech Stack:** Specify what you used (AWS S3, Lambda, Redis, etc.).
> 3.  **Action Verbs:** End with strong verbs like "Achieved", "Improved", "Reduced".

## 🧬 Anatomy of Prompt (Why it works?)

1.  **Force Quantification:** The core of a dev resume is **Quantitative Result**. Forcing AI to "Make up numbers (Estimate)" creates impact. (Of course, it must be defensible in interview!)
2.  **Specific Tech Stack:** Instead of "Worked hard", it guides to write "Introduced Redis". Good for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) too.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Rejection)

> - Performed image loading speed improvement
> - AWS experience

### ✅ After (Pass)

> - **Reduced Image Load Time 3.5s -> 0.8s (approx 77%):** Introduced On-the-fly resizing via AWS Lambda@Edge and optimized CloudFront caching strategy, contributing to 15% decrease in bounce rate.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Resume is not an 'Autobiography'. It's a **'Sales Brochure of YOU'**.
Hire AI as your copywriter.

Your code is great.
It just needs better packaging.
**Time to unwrap and repackage.** 🍷
