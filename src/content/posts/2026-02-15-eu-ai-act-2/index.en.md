February 15, 2026, marks a pivotal moment for the European Union's AI Act. Phase 2 of the legislation has entered into force, introducing unprecedented strict regulations specifically targeting **Generative Video**. The global tech industry is on high alert.

## What Has Changed?

The core focus is on 'identifiability' and 'accountability'.

### 1. Mandatory Watermarking

Any generative video content distributed within the EU must now include not only a visible label but also a metadata-level **irreversible watermark**. This is a mandatory technical requirement for major video generation tools like Sora, Runway, Pika, and others, to be applied automatically upon generation.

### 2. Immediate Platform Takedown

Major platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram are now legally obligated to detect and block non-watermarked generative videos in real-time. Failure to do so can result in fines of up to 7% of global annual turnover, far exceeding previous GDPR penalties.

### 3. Transparency Logs

Companies developing generative video models must submit 'transparency logs' to EU regulators, detailing the copyright information of the training data used and how the models operate.

## Industry Reaction

The tech industry is reeling. The open-source AI community has pushed back, calling it "excessive censorship that stifles creative freedom." However, the European Commission maintains its stance that these are "essential safeguards to prevent social chaos caused by deepfakes and disinformation."

Already, some platforms have begun implementing stricter upload filtering for European users, leading to reports of false positives where regular user videos are being blocked.

## Impact on Creators

Creators using AI tools must now clearly disclose that their content was generated by AI. It goes beyond simply stating "Made with AI"; failure to use the platform-provided tagging systems correctly could lead to account suspension or other penalties.

## Conclusion: The Cost of Trust

EU AI Act Phase 2 is humanity's grand experiment to secure trust in digital content. As the tug-of-war between the speed of technological advancement and the pace of regulation intensifies, 2026 will be the watershed year.
