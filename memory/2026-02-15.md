## 🏭 Hello Prompt Factory V5.5 (The Unifactory)

- **Problem:** Parallel sub-agents caused massive git merge conflicts and worktree locks.
- **Solution:** Replaced `run_factory.sh` with `unifactory.py`.
- **Mechanism:** Sequential processing (Research → Critic → Write → QA → Commit → Release) on `develop` branch.
- **Outcome:** Eliminated "Pull Request is not mergeable" errors.

## ⚖️ Quality Model Upgrade (V2.0)

- **Score:** Increased to **800 points**.
- **New Criteria:** Added "8. Contextual Delivery" (Pain Point, Workflow Integration, Narrative Arc).
- **Enforcement:** Implemented `CriticAgent` to reject drafts scoring < 95/100.

## 🧬 Skin Expert V6.0

- **Logic:** Integrated **Senolytics** (Fisetin/Quercetin) and **RLHF** (Safety Penalties).
- **Safety:** Implemented "Recovery Protocols" (LDM/Oxygen) instead of hard rejections for pregnant/sensitive users.
