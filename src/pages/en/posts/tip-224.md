_"Can I contact a stranger abruptly? What if they ignore me?"_

Don't worry. People don't dislike someone respecting them as a role model and asking for advice. They just dislike **'rude or annoying'** requests. Send a polite message that respects the other person's time while stimulating curiosity.

---

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Mention the other person's profile or recent activities (articles, projects) to express interest.
2. Clearly state who I am and why I contacted 'you specifically'.
3. Include a CTA (Call To Action) asking if a short (15 minutes) call or chat is possible without burden.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Thinking only about myself)

```text
"Hello. I'm a job seeker, please give me some advice.
When are you free?" (Guaranteed ignore)
```

### ✅ After (Considerate of others)

```text
"Hello, OO. I contacted you after getting great inspiration from reading your 'Junior Growth Diary' on Brunch recently.
As a 3rd-year marketer having similar concerns,
OO's experience seems to be a great milestone for my career direction.
If you don't mind, could I ask for advice briefly via Zoom for about 15 minutes next week?
I will adjust to your convenient time."
```

Have courage and press 'Send'. Nothing to lose. ☕️
