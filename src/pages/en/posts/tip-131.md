## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

Q: "Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0"
A: "x = 2 or x = 3." (End)

> (Unkind answer)

### ✅ After (Result)

**[Key Concept]**
Use 'Factorization'.

**[Solving Process]**
**Step 1: Find factors**
Multiply to +6, Add to -5 -> -2 and -3.

**Step 2: Rewrite**
$$(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$$

**Step 3: Solve**
$$x - 2 = 0 \rightarrow x = 2$$
$$x - 3 = 0 \rightarrow x = 3$$
