_"I dreamed that my teeth were falling out. Is someone going to die?"_

Dreams we have are often not simple precognitive dreams, but expressions of current stress or suppressed emotions unconsciously. Instead of asking a fortune teller, ask AI that analyzes psychological symbols. You might discover your real worries deep in your heart.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1.  Input the content of the dream, and it analyzes major symbols (teeth, sea, fall, etc.) that appear.
2.  Infer the current psychological state based on Jungian or Freudian psychology.
