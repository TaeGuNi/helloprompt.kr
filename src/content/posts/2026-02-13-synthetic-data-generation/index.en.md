## Facing the Limits of Data

In the mid-2020s, AI researchers hit the wall of 'data exhaustion'. AI models trained on all text and images on the internet stopped showing performance improvements. In response, 'Synthetic Data' has emerged as the mainstream solution in 2026.

## What is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is virtual data generated by AI algorithms, not collected from the real world. It perfectly mimics the statistical characteristics of real data while completely eliminating privacy concerns.

### Key Applications:
1.  **Autonomous Driving Simulation**: Generating infinite driving data for dangerous near-accident situations that are hard to obtain in reality, improving safety.
2.  **Financial Fraud Detection**: Generating large amounts of rare fraud patterns to train AI detection capabilities.
3.  **Medical Image Analysis**: Generating rare disease data to improve the accuracy of diagnostic AI.

## An Infinite Source of Data

Now, AI is evolving beyond human-made data through AI-made data. Synthetic data drastically reduces the cost and time of data collection and is becoming a key driver accelerating AI democratization.

## Conclusion

If data is the new oil, synthetic data is infinitely renewable green energy. We are moving away from the fear of data shortage and entering an era of creativity.
