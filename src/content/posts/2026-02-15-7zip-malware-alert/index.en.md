# Fake 7-Zip Site Alert: 7zip.com

**Security Alert:** It has been confirmed that **`7zip.com`**, a fake website impersonating the famous open-source file compression program **7-Zip**, is distributing malware.

According to security communities like Malwarebytes and Hacker News, the domain is designed very similarly to the official site **`7-zip.org`** to deceive users, and installation files downloaded from here contain malicious code.

## What is the problem?

*   **Domain Confusion**: The official site is **7-zip.org**. However, many users accidentally access `7zip.com` by typing it into Google search or the address bar.
*   **Deceptive Disguise**: Fake sites mimic the design of the official site or reassure users with a more sophisticated design.
*   **Malware Infection**: Executing a file downloaded from that site may install information-stealing malware (Stealers) or ransomware along with the 7-Zip installation.

## How to Respond

1.  **Delete Immediately**: If you have recently downloaded a file from `7zip.com`, delete the file immediately and do not execute it.
2.  **System Scan**: If you have already installed it, perform a full system scan with a trusted antivirus program (Malwarebytes, Windows Defender, etc.).
3.  **Use Official Site**: 7-Zip must be downloaded ONLY from the official homepage [**https://www.7-zip.org/**](https://www.7-zip.org/).
4.  **Share with Others**: Share this information with colleagues or friends to prevent damage.

Checking the official distribution channel is the first step in security for open-source software.
