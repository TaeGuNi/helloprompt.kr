_"Do you have to do competitor research but are stuck on where to start looking? Don't flounder in the sea of information."_

In market research, information collection is important, but 'what criteria' you use to analyze the collected information is key. It is much more efficient to ask AI for an analysis framework first and then have it organize the information according to that framework.

> ⚠️ **Caution:** ChatGPT's (free version) knowledge may not be up to date. Use an AI with web browsing capabilities or the latest model, or use it to set the 'framework' of analysis.
