_"If you submit a resume translated by Papago, native speakers will see 'Konglish' written all over it."_

English resumes have different grammar from Korean resumes. You must omit the subject (I) and start with strong **Action Verbs**. Don't just ask AI to translate, assign it the role of a 'Resume Writer'.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input Korean resume content.
2. Convert to standard English-speaking resume format (Subject omission, Past tense verb start).
3. Use job-specific jargon to increase professionalism.
