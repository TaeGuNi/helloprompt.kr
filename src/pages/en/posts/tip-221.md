## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Just Accepting)

```text
"Thank you. I will join." (End)
-> Accepting what is given.
```

### ✅ After (Attempting Counter Offer)

```text
"I deeply appreciate the offer you proposed. Company A is my number one choice that I really want to join.
However, to be honest, I am contemplating because I received a slightly higher salary offer from another company.
If you could adjust my salary to 65 million won, I would like to choose Company A without hesitation."
-> Salary increase upon success! Break-even even if failed.
```
