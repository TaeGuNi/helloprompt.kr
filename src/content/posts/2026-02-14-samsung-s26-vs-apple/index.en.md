February 2026 marks another showdown between Samsung and Apple. This time, the battlefield isn't just hardware specs, but **On-device AI**. We compare their technical approaches to reducing cloud dependency while maximizing security and speed.

## Core Hardware: NPU vs Neural Engine

The biggest shift is the massive leap in dedicated AI processors.

### Samsung Galaxy S26 (Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 / Exynos 2600)

Samsung has perfected 'Hybrid AI' with the S26 series.

- **NPU Performance:** 75 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second)
- **Features:** Supports INT4 precision to drastically reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. Excels in real-time translation and video generation AI.
- **RAM:** Standard 16GB, Ultra models up to 24GB, capable of running 13B parameter LLMs entirely on-device.

### Apple iPhone 17 Pro (A20 Bionic)

Apple focused on 'Efficiency' and 'Integration'.

- **Neural Engine Performance:** 65 TOPS
- **Features:** While the raw TOPS is lower, Apple Silicon's Unified Memory Architecture provides overwhelming data transfer bandwidth. This results in smoother latency for app prediction and personalized Siri experiences.
- **RAM:** Upgraded to 16GB for Pro models.

## Key AI Feature Comparison

### 1. Real-time Communication

- **Galaxy S26:** 'AI Live Translate' now translates voice messages in third-party apps (WhatsApp, Telegram) in real-time, not just video calls. Latency is under 0.2 seconds, practically simultaneous interpreting.
- **iPhone 17:** 'FaceTime AI' analyzes voice tone and facial expressions to enhance emotive avatars, but in pure translation speed, Galaxy holds a slight edge.

### 2. Generative AI & Productivity

- **Galaxy S26:** 'S Note' summarization is vastly improved. Beyond shrinking text, it separates speakers in meeting recordings and automatically adds context-aware 'Action Items' to your calendar.
- **iPhone 17:** 'Deep Siri' dissolves boundaries between apps. Complex commands like "Find photos of people in red from my Busan trip last week and post them to Instagram" are executed in one go.

### 3. Photo & Video Editing

- **Galaxy S26:** Features 'Video AI Eraser', allowing users to naturally remove unwanted passersby from videos after shooting. This is a high-load computation rarely seen on mobile.
- **iPhone 17:** Depth control and lighting adjustments are perfectly flexible even post-capture. 'Generative Fill' is integrated at the OS level, usable across all image editing apps.

## Conclusion: Power User vs Ecosystem Integration

The Galaxy S26 is for the **Power User** who wants "everything processed right on the device." With 24GB RAM and a powerful NPU, it's a mobile workstation.

The iPhone 17 aims to be the **"Assistant that knows you best."** Instead of raw specs, it focuses on the tight integration of OS and hardware to anticipate user intent.

In 2026, what is your choice? The extreme of hardware, or the magic of software?
