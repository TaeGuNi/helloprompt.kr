If 2024 and 2025 were the years of the 'AI Coding Assistant', 2026 might be the year of the 'AI Cleaner'.

**Stoat**, a tool making waves in the developer community, is taking a path completely opposite to existing AI tools. While GitHub Copilot or Cursor focused on writing "more code" quickly, Stoat's goal is singular:

> **"Deleting code."**

## AI Pays Back the Technical Debt Created by AI

The popularization of LLM-based coding tools exploded productivity, but not without side effects. AI-generated code often became unnecessarily verbose, included redundant logic, or introduced excessive abstractions mismatched to the context. Developers found themselves spending more time "reviewing and organizing AI-written code" than writing it.

Stoat tackles this exact problem.

### Key Features of Stoat

1.  **Semantic De-duplication:**
    Instead of simply finding identical text, it identifies logic that performs the same function and merges it into a single function or replaces it with more concise syntax.

2.  **Boilerplate Reduction:**
    It detects defensive coding habits or unnecessary type declarations commonly generated by LLMs and refactors them into concise forms leveraging the latest language syntax.

3.  **Dead Code Hunting:**
    Analyzing project-wide dependencies, it finds 'ghost functions' generated by AI but never actually called, boldly suggesting their deletion.

## The Return of "Less is More"

Stoat's slogan is **"The best code is no code."** Users feel a thrill seeing the reduced Lines of Code (LOC) after running Stoat.

One senior developer tweeted:
_"Ran Stoat yesterday and blew away 30% of our legacy code. Functionality is identical, bugs are down, and readability is way up. This is the real blessing of AI."_

## Conclusion

Anyone can generate code now. But deleting unnecessary code and leaving only the essence still requires a high level of insight. Stoat is the first attempt to automate that insight.
