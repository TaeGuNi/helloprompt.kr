The core of any gripping mystery lies in the 'How' and the 'Why'. The catharsis readers experience when a seemingly impossible locked-room trick or a foolproof alibi is finally shattered is unparalleled. But designing these headache-inducing, watertight tricks can take weeks of agonizing plotting. Now, you can leave the heavy lifting of intricate trick design to AI and focus entirely on your narrative and character development.

## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

Creating a compelling mystery isn't just about the murder itself; it's about the dance of misdirection. What makes this prompt exceptionally powerful is its insistence on _logical constraints_. By explicitly banning clichés like the "secret twin" trope, we force the AI to think harder and rely on structural brilliance—like thermal expansion, psychological blind spots, or mechanical time-delays.

I highly recommend iterating on the **Decisive Clue** section. If the AI suggests a clue that feels too obvious, simply reply with: _"Make the clue more subtle. It should be something the police overlook during the initial investigation, but the detective realizes its importance later."_ This refines the 'Aha!' moment and drastically improves reader satisfaction.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this prompt work well with standard (free) AI models?**
  - A: Yes, it works decently. However, for highly complex physical tricks or airtight logical consistency, premium models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet perform significantly better. They are less prone to creating logical loopholes in their trick designs.

- **Q: The tricks generated are sometimes too scientifically complex. What should I do?**
  - A: You can easily adjust the prompt! Add a constraint like: _"The trick must be understandable to a middle-school student and rely on everyday household objects rather than complex chemistry."_

- **Q: Can I use this for tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) like Call of Cthulhu or Murder Mystery games?**
  - A: Absolutely. This is a game-changer for Game Masters (GMs). Just change the 'Context' line to _"I am designing a Murder Mystery TRPG scenario"_ to get interactive clues suited for players to discover through investigation rolls.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Dual Persona Injection:** Combining the names of two distinct masters (Agatha Christie for classic whodunit structure, Keigo Higashino for psychological depth) guides the AI's tone and creativity simultaneously.
2. **Strict Constraints:** Explicitly banning lazy tropes forces the AI to dig deeper into its latent knowledge of physics, psychology, and logic to construct a genuine puzzle.
3. **Structured Output (Trick -> Alibi -> Clue):** By breaking the mystery down into these three mandatory pillars, the output immediately becomes a usable, structurally sound plot rather than a rambling story summary.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Simple Input)

> "Recommend a locked-room murder trick."

_(The AI provides a generic response about slipping a key under the door with a piece of string—a trope used countless times since the 1920s.)_

### ✅ After (Using the Pro Prompt)

- **Culprit:** The Indebted Housekeeper
- **Trick:** The "Thermal Expansion" illusion. The victim wasn't killed inside the locked room; they were sniped from the outside through an open window. The culprit had secretly loosened the screws of the window frame the day before and cranked the room's central heating to the maximum. The heat caused the metal frame to expand, tightly jamming the window shut. As the room cooled down during the police investigation, the window appeared to have been locked from the inside all along.
- **Alibi:** The housekeeper was seen cooking in the 1st-floor kitchen at the estimated time of death. However, she manipulated the time of death by leaving the victim on a heating pad, confusing the coroner's initial body temperature assessment.
- **Decisive Clue:** The room was sweltering hot when discovered, yet the victim was wearing a thick wool sweater. Furthermore, while the rest of the windows in the cold villa had condensation, the frame of the specific window used for the trick had none, indicating it had been exposed to the freezing outside air recently.
