## 💡 Writer's Insight

The wedding industry is notorious for the "wedding tax" and aggressive upselling tactics. Couples often start with a simple spreadsheet, only to realize months later that they completely forgot to budget for vendor meals, postage for heavy invitations, dress alterations, or "++" (plus plus) service charges that add over 20% to the catering bill.

This prompt is incredibly effective because it doesn't just give you a generic list; it forces the AI to act as a **defensive planner**. By clearly defining your priorities and non-negotiables upfront, the AI tailors the budget to reflect what you actually care about, while aggressively highlighting the hidden traps where vendors typically extract more money. I highly recommend running this prompt _before_ you tour a single venue or speak to a single vendor. It gives you the baseline financial literacy needed to negotiate confidently.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use this for a destination wedding?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just add "Destination Wedding in `[Location]`" to the Context section. The AI will immediately adjust the categories to include travel, accommodation, welcome bags, and local legal fees for the ceremony.

- **Q: What if my budget is extremely tight (e.g., under $5,000)?**
  - A: The AI handles micro-budgets brilliantly. It will skip traditional, expensive venues and instead suggest parks, restaurant buyouts, digital invitations, and DIY alternatives, effectively reshaping the entire checklist to fit your financial reality without judgment.

- **Q: Does this work for different cultural weddings that last multiple days?**
  - A: Yes. If your culture has specific multi-day events or traditional ceremonies (like a Mehndi, Tea Ceremony, or specific gifting customs), simply mention them in the Context. The AI will expand the budget categories to accommodate those specific traditions.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Dual Persona (Planner + Advisor):** By combining the aesthetic focus of a wedding planner with the strictness of a financial advisor, the AI balances the desire for a beautiful event with harsh financial realities.
2. **Priority-Based Allocation:** Instead of a generic, one-size-fits-all template, it reallocates funds based on what the couple actually cares about, ensuring maximum return on investment for their happiness.
3. **Proactive Defense:** The "Vendor Negotiation Guide" and "Hidden Cost Warning List" transform this from a simple calculator into a strategic negotiation tool.
