_"Don't you want to use "I'm good to go" or "Couldn't be better" instead of "I'm fine thank you"?"_

More than 50% of expressions native speakers use in daily life are Idioms and Slang. They are often used completely differently from dictionary meanings, so it's easy to misunderstand if you don't know the context. This prompt changes plain sentences into expressions used by 'kids these days' or 'sophisticated urbanites'.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"I am very tired."

### ✅ After (Result)

**[Version 1: Trendy Slang]**
"I'm totally **fried**." / "I'm **beat**."

**[Version 2: Classic Idiom]**
"I'm **running on fumes**." / "I'm **burned out**."

**[Explanation]**

- _Running on fumes_: Means car fuel ran out and it goes only on vapor (fume). State of depleted energy.
- _Fried_: Means brain doesn't work as if fried. When mentally exhausted.

**[Caution]**

- _Beat_ is very wholesome, but _Wasted_ means 'drunk and wasted' state, so using it when simply tired can be misunderstood!

## 🎯 Conclusion

Language is culture. Every time you learn an idiom, you understand one piece of their culture. Try using "I could eat a horse" instead of "Very hungry" from today.

Now leave work on time and go have Chi-maek! (It's time to hit the road!) 🍷
