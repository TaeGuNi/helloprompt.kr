_"When a child comes home sullen saying 'So-and-so won't play with me', the parent's first words are important."_

Unconditionally blaming the friend or taking only the child's side is not the solution. Acknowledge that everyone's heart can be different, and teach how to accept rejection healthily or how to approach.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Respect for others' feelings and intentions
2. Resilience to rejection
3. Healthy relationship building skills
