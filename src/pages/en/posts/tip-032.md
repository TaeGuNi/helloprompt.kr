>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Write a **Bash Shell Script** that performs the requirements below.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Requirements)

"Move all JPG files in the current folder to the images folder, and change the filenames to date_originalname.jpg."

### ✅ After (Result)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Stop script on error

TARGET_DIR="images"
DATE_PREFIX=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 1. Create target directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$TARGET_DIR" ]; then
    echo "📁 Creating '$TARGET_DIR' directory..."
    mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"
fi

# 2. Move JPG files and rename
echo "🚀 Starting file move..."
for file in *.jpg; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        new_name="${DATE_PREFIX}_${file}"
        mv "$file" "$TARGET_DIR/$new_name"
        echo "✅ Moved: $file -> $TARGET_DIR/$new_name"
    fi
done

echo "🎉 All tasks completed!"
```
