In February 2026, AI technology has taken another giant leap forward. With the advent of GPT-5, we are now living in the era of Autonomous Agents—AI that doesn't just 'ask and answer', but 'sets goals and achieves them'.

## What are Autonomous Agents?

While traditional LLMs (Large Language Models) reacted passively to user prompts, Autonomous Agents are proactive. If you say "Plan a trip for me," the agent doesn't just draft an itinerary; it books flights, reserves hotels, and makes restaurant reservations on its own.

### Key Features
1. **Long-term Memory**: Remembers past interactions and maintains context continuously.
2. **Tool Use**: Freely uses web browsing, code execution, API calls, and more.
3. **Planning**: Breaks down complex goals into detailed steps and executes them sequentially.

## Changes Brought by GPT-5

GPT-5 boasts dramatically improved reasoning and multimodal processing capabilities compared to previous models. These are essential for agents to understand and cope with the complex variables of the real world. AI is now starting to function not just as an assistant, but as a reliable 'colleague'.

## Future Outlook

The ubiquity of Autonomous Agents heralds a revolution in productivity. Repetitive and tedious tasks can be delegated to agents, allowing humans to focus on more creative and strategic decision-making. However, social discussions on ethical issues and job displacement are becoming equally urgent.

We stand at the threshold of a new era where AI and humans truly collaborate.
