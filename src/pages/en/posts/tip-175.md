_"I bought it because it's popular, but it gives me a headache? I want a scent that matches my image."_

Scent is invisible fashion. Finding a perfume that fits my taste (Notes) and image is not easy. Ask AI for a specific perfume list based on your favorite scents (Citrus, Woody, Musk, etc.) and atmosphere.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Analyze preferences for scent notes (Top/Middle/Base).
2. Recommend brands/products matching desired image (Sexy, Innocent, Professional).
3. Guide how to use (Spraying location, Layering) to make the scent last longer.
