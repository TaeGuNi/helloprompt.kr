# Research Entry: Advanced Delivery Systems for Regenerative Actives

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** Protocol Optimization & Clinical Application
**Topic:** Transdermal Delivery of Macromolecules (PDRN / Exosomes)

## 1. Challenge: The Barrier Problem

- **Stratum Corneum:** Main obstacle for molecules >500 Da (Daltons).
- **PDRN Size:** ~50-2000 kDa (requires assistance).
- **Exosome Size:** ~30-150 nm (nanoparticles, lipophilic but large).

## 2. Physical Enhancement Methods

### Microneedling (MTS / Collagen Induction Therapy)

- **Mechanism:** Creates temporary micro-channels (mechanical perforation).
- **Synergy:**
  - **With PDRN:** Excellent. DNA fragments migrate through channels easily.
  - **With Exosomes:** Highly effective. Exosomes signal wound healing directly into the dermis initiated by the needle trauma.
- **Protocol Depth:**
  - **Epidermal (0.25-0.5mm):** Enhances absorption only.
  - **Dermal (0.75-1.5mm):** Triggers collagen cascade + delivery.
- **Risk:** Needle reuse (dulling), cross-contamination, granuloma formation if products aren't sterile/pyrogen-free.

### Fractional Laser (Non-Ablative / Ablative)

- **Mechanism:** Creates thermal zones (Microthermal Treatment Zones - MTZ).
- **Application:** "Laser-assisted drug delivery" (LADD).
- **Timing:** Apply actives _immediately_ post-laser (within 2-5 mins) before coagulation seals channels.

## 3. Chemical & Electrical Enhancement

### Electroporation (EP)

- **Mechanism:** High-voltage pulses create transient aqueous pores in lipid bilayers.
- **Benefit:** Non-invasive, painless, no downtime.
- **Best For:** Hydrophilic molecules (PDRN is highly hydrophilic).
- **Efficiency:** Increases permeability by >100x compared to topical application.

### Liposomal Encapsulation (Nano-carriers)

- **Mechanism:** Mimics cell membrane (phospholipid bilayer).
- **Advantage:** Protects fragile actives (exosomes) from degradation on skin surface.
- **Innovation:** "Deformable Liposomes" (Transfersomes) squeeze through intercellular spaces.

## 4. Clinical Protocol Recommendations (Draft)

| Active              | Primary Method           | Secondary Method      | Post-Care                  |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **PDRN**            | Injection (Mesotherapy)  | Microneedling (0.5mm) | Occlusive mask (hydrogel)  |
| **Exosomes**        | Microneedling (0.25mm)   | Electroporation       | No acidic products for 24h |
| **Hyaluronic Acid** | Injection (Cross-linked) | Ultrasound (Low-MW)   | Lipid barrier repair cream |

## 5. Future Investigation

- **Sonophoresis (Ultrasound):** Frequency modulation for depth control.
- **Dissolving Microneedles:** Patches with crystallized PDRN/Exosomes.
