_"Others write cool posts well, but I have nothing to write about..."_

It's not just grand success stories that become posts. Rather, **'small failures and learnings'** gain greater empathy. If you throw a trivial episode you experienced at work today to AI, it cooks it into an 'insight post' that calls for likes.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Diary)

```text
The meeting failed today. The team leader said my proposal wasn't good.
I'll do better next time. Depressed.
(0 Likes)
```

### ✅ After (Insight Post)

```text
"Planning without data is not planning, it's fiction." 📉

This is a lesson I learned the hard way in today's meeting.
My ambitious proposal collapsed at the team leader's single remark, "So what is the basis?".

I was upset at first, but looking back, my proposal only had 'feeling' and no 'fact'.
[Content of realization...]
