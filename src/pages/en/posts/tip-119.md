\_"I want to make a simple and angular 3D character removing complex descriptions."

**Low Poly** is a 3D art style expressed angularly by reducing the number of polygons (faces), and **Voxel** is a style stacked with blocks like Lego or Minecraft. Both give clean, modern, and cute feelings.\_

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. `Low poly` is like origami with split faces, `Voxel` is like stacking blocks.
2. Cleaner when used with `Minimalist`, `Flat shading`.
3. Perfect match with `Isometric view`.
