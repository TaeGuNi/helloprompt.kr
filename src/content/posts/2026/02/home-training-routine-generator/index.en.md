Following YouTube workout videos is great, but it's often difficult to gauge if the intensity is right for your specific fitness level. If it's too easy, you won't see results; if it's too hard, you risk injury. By simply telling an AI your current level, available time, and goals, you can receive a perfectly tailored workout routine that maximizes efficiency and safety.

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need a highly detailed, personalized workout plan.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below and paste it into ChatGPT or Claude.

> **Role:** You are a Professional Personal Trainer with 10 years of experience and a certified Rehabilitation Specialist.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Current Status: I am an `[Exercise Beginner]` planning to work out at home.
> - Constraints: I can dedicate `[30 minutes]` a day. The only equipment I have is `[a yoga mat and two 2kg dumbbells]`.
> - Goal: I specifically want to focus on `[losing belly fat and correcting forward head posture (turtle neck)]`.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Plan a complete routine consisting of a Warm-up, Main Exercise, and Cool-down (Stretching).
> 2. For the main exercise, target my specific areas of concern (`[Abdomen, Back]`) while ensuring the whole body is engaged evenly.
> 3. Instead of lengthy descriptions of each movement, organize the exercise names, sets, repetitions, and rest times in a clear table.
> 4. Indicate the exercise intensity (RPE) as a number between 1 and 10 so beginners can easily understand the required effort.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Strictly exclude any jumping movements (e.g., Burpees) that could cause noise complaints from neighbors downstairs.
> - For any movements that put strain on the knees, provide low-impact alternatives.
> - Output the final routine exclusively as a Markdown table.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is exceptionally effective because it mimics a real consultation with a personal trainer. By defining strict constraints—like avoiding jumping exercises to prevent noise complaints, a common issue for apartment dwellers—the AI generates a highly practical routine. Furthermore, specifying the exact equipment available prevents the AI from suggesting exercises you simply can't perform. If you feel the generated routine is too easy after a few days, simply ask the AI to "Increase the RPE by 2" or "Add progression variants," and it will dynamically adjust your plan.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use this prompt if I have no equipment at all?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just change the equipment variable to `[no equipment, bodyweight only]`. The AI will generate a highly effective calisthenics routine.

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, GPT-3.5 or Claude 3 Haiku can handle this perfectly. However, for more complex rehabilitation constraints, using a more advanced model like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet might yield safer, more accurate alternative exercises.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Rehabilitation Specialist Role:** By assigning the persona of a rehabilitation expert, the AI prioritizes safety and posture correction over simply burning calories.
2. **Environmental Constraints:** Specifying "no jumping movements" tailors the output perfectly for home or apartment environments, removing a major barrier to consistency.
3. **Structured Output:** Forcing a Markdown table format makes the routine highly scannable and easy to follow during a workout, without getting bogged down in text.
