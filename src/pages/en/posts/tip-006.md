_"Are you still struggling to interpret `^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$` just to validate an email?"_

Regular Expressions (Regex) are essential for developers but often one of the most dreaded areas. Every time you write one, you have to look up the syntax, and reading someone else's code feels like deciphering an alien language. Stop suffering and just tell AI the 'pattern'.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Don't struggle with memorizing or searching for complex regex syntax.
2. Just describe the pattern you want (phone number, email, etc.), and AI will write the regex and explain it.
3. Request test code along with the regex to immediately verify its accuracy.

## 🧬 Why it works?

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
Write me a Korean mobile phone regex. Hyphen optional. 011 allowed besides 010.
```

<br>

### ✅ After (Output)

```javascript
// JavaScript Example

const regex = /^01([0|1|6|7|8|9])-?([0-9]{3,4})-?([0-9]{4})$/;

// Test
const phone1 = "010-1234-5678"; // Match O
const phone2 = "01012345678"; // Match O
const phone3 = "02-123-4567"; // Match X

console.log(regex.test(phone1)); // true
```

### 🔍 Explanation

- `^`: Start of string
- `01([0|1|6|7|8|9])`: Starts with 01 followed by one of 0,1,6,7,8,9 (Identifier)
- `-?`: Hyphen (-) exists 0 or 1 time (Optional)
- `([0-9]{3,4})`: Numbers 0-9 appear 3 or 4 times (Middle digits)
- `([0-9]{4})`: Numbers 0-9 appear 4 times (Last digits)
- `$`: End of string

## 🎯 Conclusion

Don't open the regex grammar book. You just need to know clearly what 'pattern' you want.
