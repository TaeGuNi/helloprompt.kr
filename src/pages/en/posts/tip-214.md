_"Hello, I am an applicant like an onion... (Interviewer: Sigh...)"_

A 1-minute self-introduction is a preview that buys the interviewer time to scan your resume. If you don't make them listen here, you might become a folding screen for the whole hour. Discard clichéd metaphors and win with **'Head-first Competency Summary'**.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Select 2 of my core competencies (job strengths).
2. Summarize the experiences that can prove this in one line each.
3. Plan a script with a structure that concludes by revealing aspirations on how to contribute to the company.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Cliché)

```text
"Hello! I am applicant Kim Chul-soo like a sponge.
I will learn as if sucking up water anywhere.
Listening well to my parents since I was young..." (Too long, boring)
```

### ✅ After (Impact)

```text
"Hello. I am Kim Chul-soo, a 'Marketer who reads customers' minds with data'.
I have two strengths.
First, through 3 years of e-commerce operation experience, I learned the sense of analyzing data and connecting it to sales.
Second, I acquired global business manners by communicating directly with English-speaking customers.
Based on these capabilities, I want to contribute to the 10% growth of your company's global sales after joining."
```
