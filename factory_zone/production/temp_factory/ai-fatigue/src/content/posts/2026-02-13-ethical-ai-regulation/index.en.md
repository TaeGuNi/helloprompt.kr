"Will AI replace humans, or complement them?" This question has now shifted to "How do we control AI?" In 2026, the world is busy establishing guidelines to prevent AI technology from running amok and to ensure safe coexistence.

## Global Regulatory Trends

With the full implementation of the EU's 'AI Act', standards for AI regulation are being set globally.

1.  **Risk-based Approach**: AI systems are classified by risk level, with strict regulations applied to high-risk AI (healthcare, hiring, legal, etc.).
2.  **Transparency Obligations**: Content generated by AI must be marked (Watermarking) to indicate it was created by AI.
3.  **Data Copyright**: Models are being introduced that specify the copyright of data used for training and provide fair compensation to creators.

## The War on Bias

Since AI learns from past data, the problem of replicating existing societal biases remains serious. Building 'ethical datasets' and continuous monitoring are essential to prevent discriminatory remarks or decisions against specific races or genders.

## Our Stance

Technology is value-neutral, but the people who use it are not. Developers must code with ethical awareness, and users must cultivate 'AI Literacy' to critically accept AI outputs.

Regulation is not a shackle on innovation, but a compass that guides innovation in the right direction.
