# 📝 Too Lazy to Write Test Code? AI Does It for You

> **🎯 Recommended for:** Everyone
> **⏱️ Time required:** 5 minutes

_"Too busy implementing features to write test code? But without tests, you have to tremble with anxiety every time you deploy."_

Unit tests are essential for stable services, but they are tedious and time-consuming to write. In particular, it is difficult to carefully take care of exception situations (Edge Cases). Leave this boring task to AI and focus on logic implementation.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. If you leave the cumbersome task of writing unit tests to AI, it will even take care of exception cases meticulously.
2. It generates robust tests that consider not only success cases (Happy Path) but also edge cases.
3. Assign the role of QA engineer to increase test coverage and ensure code stability.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below and paste it into ChatGPT or Claude.

> **Role:** You are a `[QA Engineering Lead]`.
>
> **Context:** I need to write unit test code for the `[function/class]` I wrote. Use `[Test framework in use]`.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Write a success case (Happy Path) test for normal input.
> 2. Identify 3 or more potential exception situations and edge cases, and write failure tests for them.
> 3. Add comments to the test code explaining what each case verifies.
>
> **Code to Test:**
> `[Paste your code here]`

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input: Simple calculation function)

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero.");
  return a / b;
}
```

<br>

### ✅ After (Result)

```javascript
// Example using Jest framework

describe("divide function tests", () => {
  // 1. Happy Path: Normal division
  test("10 divided by 2 should be 5", () => {
    expect(divide(10, 2)).toBe(5);
  });

  // 2. Edge Case: Negative division
  test("dividing negative numbers should handle signs correctly", () => {
    expect(divide(-10, 2)).toBe(-5);
    expect(divide(-10, -2)).toBe(5);
  });

  // 3. Exception Case: Division by zero
  test("dividing by 0 should throw an error", () => {
    expect(() => divide(10, 0)).toThrow("Cannot divide by zero.");
  });

  // 4. Edge Case: Decimal precision
  test("division result should be accurate when it's a decimal", () => {
    expect(divide(5, 2)).toBe(2.5);
  });
});
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Test code is insurance for your future self. Use AI to dramatically lower the insurance premium (writing time).
