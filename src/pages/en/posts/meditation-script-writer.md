_"Are YouTube meditation videos too long and boring? Create a 3-minute meditation script perfect for my mood right now yourself."_

We know meditation is good, but sitting still is torture for many. The important thing is not 'length' but 'immersion'. Explain your situation to AI and receive a guide script that will lead you calmly. (It's icing on the cake if you read it with TTS!)

1. Input current situation (on the way to work, before bed, etc.) and desired atmosphere.
