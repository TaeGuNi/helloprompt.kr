# 3 Things Every AI Beginner Must Do First

- **🎯 Recommended for:** Anyone who wants to try AI but doesn't know where to start
- **⏱️ Time required:** 5 minutes
- **🤖 Recommended models:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- **📊 Difficulty:** ⭐☆☆☆☆ (Very Easy)
- **⚡️ Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Hello! I'm Jay, the operator of **Hello Prompt**.
"Everyone is talking about AI, but where should I begin?" Have you ever had this thought?

No complex theories or coding are required. Just follow the **three simple steps** I share today. These alone will put you in the top 10% of AI users.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR (3-Line Summary)

1. **Talk, Don't Search:** Don't ask like a search engine; talk like you're chatting with a human.
2. **Delegate Boring Tasks:** Hand over tasks you hate, like drafting emails or summarizing text.
3. **Assign a Role:** Hypnotize the AI by saying, "You are a 10-year Excel expert."

---

## 1. Don't Use It Like a Search Engine (Conversational)

Many people search AI with short queries like "Kimchi stew recipe." However, the true power of AI lies in understanding **'Context'**. Tell it the specific situation as if you were messaging a friend.

### 🥉 Basic Version

> **Request:** Tell me how to make delicious Kimchi stew.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Explaining the situation changes the result completely.

> **Request:** I live alone and only have **sour kimchi, a can of tuna, and onions** in my fridge. Please give me a recipe for the most delicious kimchi stew I can make with these. I'm a cooking beginner, so please explain the heat control in detail.

---

## 2. Delegate Boring Tasks (Summaries & Drafts)

What AI does best is **'Text Processing'**. Hand over long texts you don't want to read or emails you're too lazy to write.

### 🥉 Basic Version

> **Request:** Summarize this: (Paste long text)

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Specify the summary format according to your purpose.

> **Request:** Summarize the content below in **Meeting Minutes format**.
>
> 1.  Agenda
> 2.  Action Items
> 3.  Person in Charge & Deadline
>
> **[Paste Text Here]**

---

## 3. Assign a Role (Persona)

If you tell the AI, **"You are a [Role],"** it equips itself with the professional knowledge and tone appropriate for that role. This is called **Persona Setting**.

### 🥉 Basic Version

> **Request:** Teach me some Excel functions.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

> **Role:** You are a **15-year veteran Finance Team Manager** and an Excel instructor.
> **Request:** I want to extract only the 'Month' from the date data in Column A. Please explain the function with examples so that a beginner can understand easily.

---

## 🧬 Why it works?

The reason the Pro Version prompts work better is:

1.  **Specificity:** Constraints were given on 'what' to cook with and 'who' to explain to.
2.  **Structure:** The desired output format (like meeting minutes) was clearly defined.
3.  **Expertise:** By assigning a role, the AI was guided to prioritize professional data in that field.
