Hand over simple repetitive tasks to the machine.
And spend the remaining time **for yourself (exercise, reading, rest)**.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input: Messy Conversation)

What happens if you input a **"Stream of Consciousness"** conversation like below?

```text
Manager Kim: Hey, did you check the pop-up store location in Seongsu this week?
Assistant Lee: Ah, they said that place is fully booked... Hongdae is possible but it's expensive.
Manager Kim: Then look into Hongdae for now and redo the budget. Oh right, did you fix the website banner copy?
Staff Park: Ah, that... the design team is busy, they said they'll give it to us by tomorrow.
Manager Kim: It must be up by tomorrow no matter what. Park, you make sure to handle it.
```

<br>

### ✅ After (Result: Perfect Report)

AI analyzes this conversation and completes the report in **just 10 seconds**.

```text
