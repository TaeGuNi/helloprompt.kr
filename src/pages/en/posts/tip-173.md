_"If there are 1,000 numbers, it's data; if there is 1 graph, it's insight."_

Reporting financial data as raw Excel tables is amateur. Put small charts inside cells with **Sparklines**, and turn on traffic lights for important data with **Conditional Formatting**. You can create excellent dashboards using only Excel without professional BI tools (Tableau, PowerBI).

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. How to use 'Sparklines' to draw trend lines inside cells.
2. Apply 'Conditional Formatting' using data bars and icon sets.
