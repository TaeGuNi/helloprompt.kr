The era of seeking "One Prompt to Rule Them All" is over. AI engineering in 2026 focuses not on single prompts, but on designing 'Chaining' and 'Workflows' that logically connect multiple prompts.

### Divide and Conquer

Attempting to handle complex tasks in a single call inevitably degrades model performance. Prompt chaining prevents this by breaking massive tasks into smaller units and processing them sequentially.
1. Summarize document
2. Extract core keywords from summary
3. Draft based on keywords
4. Polish and style correction
By using optimized prompts for each step, the quality of the final output is maximized.

### Agentic Workflows

If chaining is a simple linear connection, agentic workflows include loops and conditions. They involve autonomous logic like "If the result is unsatisfactory, go back to step 2" or "If more information is needed, call the web search tool." Prompt engineers are now less like writers and more like 'managers' designing the workflows of AI employees.

### Human-in-the-loop

Even with full automation, placing checkpoints requiring human approval in the middle of a chain has become the standard for safe systems.
