## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly effective because it leverages the psychology of framing. By positioning the meeting as a "Performance Review and Compensation Discussion," you shift the focus from _you asking for money_ to _a mutual review of value generated for the company_.

In my experience, managers respect employees who can advocate for themselves professionally. The inclusion of a specific, quantifiable achievement in the email acts as an "anchor"—it ensures your manager walks into the meeting already thinking about your successes, putting you in a much stronger negotiating position from minute one. Never negotiate the actual number via email; use the email solely to secure the meeting on favorable terms.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Should I include the exact percentage raise I want in this email?**
  - A: Absolutely not. The purpose of this email is only to schedule the meeting and set a positive tone. Bringing up specific numbers in writing prematurely can backfire and lock you into a rigid negotiation. Save the numbers for the actual conversation.

- **Q: What if my manager ignores the email?**
  - A: Give it 48 to 72 hours. If there is no response, follow up gently in person or via your company's instant messaging tool (like Slack or Teams) by saying, "Hi `[Name]`, I just wanted to float my previous email to the top of your inbox. Let me know when you have a brief moment to chat."

- **Q: Can I use this if I work remotely?**
  - A: Yes! Just adjust the prompt slightly to ask for a "Zoom/Teams meeting" instead of a physical sit-down. The principles of highlighting your value remain exactly the same.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why does it work?)

1. **Strategic Framing:** The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to avoid mentioning specific numbers, focusing instead on securing the meeting.
2. **Anchor Placement:** By requiring the input of a `[Core Achievement]`, the AI naturally weaves your strongest bargaining chip into the meeting request.
3. **Tone Regulation:** The `Constraints` and `Warning` sections prevent the AI from generating an overly aggressive, apologetic, or emotional email, ensuring you come across as a confident professional.
