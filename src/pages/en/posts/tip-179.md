_"The culprit was the butler... readers would throw the book away, right?"_

Clichés are comfortable because they are familiar, but boring because they are predictable. A good work pretends to follow clichés and then betrays them at the decisive moment. Let's change the most obvious ending to the most shocking twist using AI.

---

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Input the cliché situation you want to use.
2. AI proposes 'most predictable development' and 'twist that overturns it'.
3. Get foreshadowing (bait) ideas to match the probability of the twist.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"The hero killed the demon king and saved the world."

### ✅ After (Twist Proposal)

**Idea 1: Cycle of Karma**

- **Twist:** As soon as the demon king is killed, the demon king's soul dwells in the hero's body. In fact, the demon king was the 'former hero', and this world was a system that could only be maintained if the hero became the demon king.
- **Foreshadowing:** The scene where the demon king didn't attack whenever he saw the hero but looked with sad eyes. The reason why the village elders sympathized with the hero instead of cheering.
