## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Passive Answer)

```text
"Ah... previous job was too hard so I quit and rested a bit.
Traveled a bit... time passed while organizing thoughts." (Looks tired)
```

### ✅ After (Positive Reinterpretation)

```text
"Last 6 months were 'run-up' time to go further.
I recovered energy exhausted from running without rest in previous job through travel,
and especially cultivated flexible mindset needed for [Applying Job] encountering various cultures.
Thanks to this period, I am now ready to immerse 200% in work without worrying about burnout."
```

Life's blank is not a period but a **comma**. Interviewer is also a person not robot, so nods to honest and confident reason for rest.

Show that your comma became driving force to start next sentence more vigorously. 🌿
