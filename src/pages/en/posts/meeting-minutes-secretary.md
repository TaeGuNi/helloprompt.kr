_"There was a lot of talk for an hour, but now that I try to organize it, I can't remember and it's messy?"_

After a meeting, only recording files or scribbled notes remain. Organizing this into a report becomes another task. Wouldn't it be great if you could just extract the important decisions and who needs to do what by when (Action Item)?
