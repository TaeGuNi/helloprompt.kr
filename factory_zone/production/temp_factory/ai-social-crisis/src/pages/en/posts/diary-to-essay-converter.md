## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Diary)

"Depressed because it rained. Want to eat green onion pancake."

### ✅ After (Essay Conversion)

**Title: On a rainy day, because the heart also needs a pancake**

There are days when the sound of rain hitting the window feels exceptionally heavy. When the sky frowns, strangely, my heart also droops like a cotton blanket soaking up moisture. (...Omitted...)
Depression might be a hungry signal sent by the heart. If I can be comforted by a sheet of savory oil-smelling green onion pancake, isn't this rain quite a decent guest?
