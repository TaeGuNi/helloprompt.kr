The tech world is drowning in noise. We call it innovation; users call it exhaustion.

## The Problem

This post explores the critical issue of **ai-fatigue**. While executives cheer for metrics, the reality on the ground is different. We are seeing a massive disconnect between promise and delivery.

This isn't just a glitch. It's a systemic failure.

## The Reality

## Conclusion

It's time to wake up. The bubble isn't bursting; it's leaking toxic sludge everywhere.
