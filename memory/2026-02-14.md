# 2026-02-14.md - Aura-Core Research & Automation Log

## Overview

Aura-Core research automation evolved from a simple cron job to a sophisticated, self-correcting AI loop (V1 -> V5). The primary goal is to build a "Safe, Empathic, and Logical" skin analysis engine without real data dependencies.

## Key Developments

### 1. Research Automation Process (V5.0)

- **Status:** **STOPPED** (Awaiting restart command).
- **Loop:** Group Context Check -> Git Sync -> Field Research -> BDD Logic Test -> Self-Review -> Doc Update -> Push -> Report.
- **Cycle:** 10 minutes (Time-sliced execution to prevent git conflicts).
- **Core Principles:**
  - **Logic First:** No data collection tasks (crawling/images). Focus on algorithmic robustness.
  - **Precision Strike:** BDD tests target reliability and logic gaps.
  - **Legal/Ethical:** Zero Image Policy (User Input Only), Volatile Reports (No storage).
  - **Documentation-Driven:** "Code is Doc, Doc is Code." Immediate reflection in `.md` files.

### 2. BDD Gym Implementation (Self-Reinforcement Learning)

- **Location:** `aura-core/tests/reinforcement/`
- **Components:**
  - `generate_scenarios.ts`: Creates 100+ random patient profiles (Age, Concerns, History, Fear).
  - `evaluate_logic.ts`: Runs the engine against scenarios, checking for Safety Violations (Critical) and Match Accuracy.
  - `run_gym.ts`: The training loop that logs results to `reinforcement_log.json`.
- **Goal:** Shift from 48 manual tests to infinite simulated stress tests.

### 3. Logic & Documentation Overhaul (V1/Korean)

- **ALGORITHM_PHASE_1.md (Safety):** Shifted from "Binary Block" to "Safe Reroute/Recovery Paths".
- **ALGORITHM_PHASE_2.md (Psych):** Shifted from "Mechanical" (Pain Tolerance) to "Empathic" (Comfort Zone).
- **ALGORITHM_PHASE_4.md (Mapping):** Introduced "Logic Canvas" to de-mystify recommendations.
- **ALGORITHM_PHASE_5.md (Report):** Removed e-commerce tone ("Best Price") -> "Clinical Reservation".
- **ROADMAP.md:** Created to track logic-first goals (Safety Rule Engine, Multimodal Logic Structure).

### 4. Git Hygiene & Strategy

- **One Clean Commit:** Agents squash changes to avoid messy logs.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Logic strictly follows `aura-core/data/treatments/master.json`.
- **Sync Status:** Successfully merged and pushed V3-V5 updates to `origin/main` (Version 1.0.806).

## Current Status (Scorecard)

- **Self-Assessment:** ~73/100 (B-)
- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Completeness:** Dead ends still exist for rejected users (need better off-ramps).
  - **Test Volume:** Gym is built but not fully integrated into the daily workflow.
  - **Tone:** Some lingering "machine-like" phrases need polishing.
