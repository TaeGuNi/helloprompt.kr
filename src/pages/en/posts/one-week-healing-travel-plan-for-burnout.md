_"Aren't you more exhausted from standing in line at tourist spots where everyone else goes?"_

True relaxation depends on 'what you don't do' rather than 'what you do'. Instead of a tight schedule, plan a one-week healing trip full of time to fill yourself.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1.  Schedule composition focused on 'experience' and 'rest' rather than tourism.

3.  Recommend refresh activities such as meditation, walking, and reading.
