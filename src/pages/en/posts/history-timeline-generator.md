_"Which comes first, Imjin War or Byeongja Horan?"_
_"Do French Revolution and Industrial Revolution overlap?"_

History is not 'dot' but 'line'. If you memorize individual events (dots), you forget quickly, but if you understand flow (line), it is memorized naturally. This prompt lines up entangled events in chronological order, and connects causal relationships (cause and effect) between events with arrows.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Sort major events of specific era or topic chronologically
2. Specify Cause (Why) and Result (Effect) of each event together

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Text Listing)

1914 Sarajevo Incident occurred. 1919 Treaty of Versailles signed. 1929 Great Depression... (Connection link invisible)

### ✅ After (Prompt Result: Around WWI)

**[Timeline]**
| Year | Event Name | Key Content | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1914 | **Sarajevo Incident** | Assassination of Austrian Crown Prince, Fuse of WWI | Act of Serbian Youth |
| 1917 | **Russian Revolution** | Led by Lenin, Birth of world's first communist state | Internal collapse during war |
| 1918 | **German Surrender** | End of WWI | Abdication of Wilhelm II |
| 1919 | **Treaty of Versailles** | Imposing harsh reparations on defeated Germany | **Seed of WWII** |

**[Causal Flow]**
Sarajevo Incident (Explosion of Nationalism) → Chain participation of allies → Boring trench warfare → Russian Revolution leads to Eastern Front departure → US participation leads to Allied victory → Harshness of Treaty of Versailles → German backlash (Hitler appearance)

**[Contemporary Korea]**

- 1919: **March 1st Movement** broke out influenced by 'National Self-Determination' of Treaty of Versailles.
