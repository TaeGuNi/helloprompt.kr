# 📝 My Code Can Be Hacked? Vulnerability Check by AI Sheriff

- **🎯 Recommended For:** Developers, Indie Hackers, and Junior Software Engineers
- **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 minutes → Reduced to 1 minute
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** All Conversational AIs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

- ⭐ **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆
- ⚡️ **Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 🚀 **Utility:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

> _"Surely no one would hack my toy project? Think again. Automated bots relentlessly scour the web, hunting for vulnerable servers to exploit."_

Your database could be drained by a single SQL injection, or your users' session cookies stolen via a trivial XSS attack.
Before you deploy that side project or merge that pull request, let the "AI Sheriff" audit your code. Catch vulnerabilities early and get a personalized "Secure Coding" prescription instantly.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Instantly identify critical security vulnerabilities in your codebase (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
2. Receive a comprehensive risk analysis based on the OWASP Top 10 standards.
3. Get actionable, secure code replacements to patch vulnerabilities before deployment.

## 🚀 The Solution: "Security Vulnerability Scanner"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need a quick, high-level security check.

> **Role:** You are a seasoned White Hat Hacker and Cyber Security Expert.
> **Request:** Analyze the provided code for common security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS, and propose secure patch codes.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this for a rigorous, production-grade security audit.

> **Role (Persona):** You are a Senior White Hat Hacker and Cyber Security Expert specializing in application security.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: I need to ensure the code I've written is safe from potential cyber threats and exploits before deploying it to production.
> - Objective: Conduct a thorough security audit of the code, identify risks, and provide secure remediation strategies.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Deeply analyze the code below and pinpoint all **Security Vulnerabilities**.
> 2. Explain the specific attack vectors (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, CSRF) that each vulnerability exposes the application to.
> 3. Provide the **Secure Code** implementation that effectively resolves these vulnerabilities.
>
> **Code to Analyze:**
>
> [Insert your suspicious or untested code here]
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Prioritize your review based on the latest OWASP Top 10 vulnerability criteria.
> - Do not just label the code as "dangerous"; provide a realistic scenario of exactly _how_ an attacker would exploit it.
>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Do not hallucinate vulnerabilities. If the code appears secure based on the provided context, state that clearly while mentioning any inherent limitations of static analysis.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Many junior developers assume that security is something you only worry about at an enterprise scale. The reality is that automated vulnerability scanners don't discriminate between a Fortune 500 company and your weekend side project.

I've used this exact prompt during code reviews to double-check legacy codebases. It's incredibly effective not just for finding flaws, but for _learning_ secure coding practices. The AI doesn't just fix the code; it explains the attack vector, helping you avoid making the same mistake twice. It acts like a senior security engineer sitting right next to you.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this replace automated security scanning tools like SonarQube?**
  - A: Not completely. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are great for CI/CD pipelines. However, this AI prompt is perfect for real-time, context-aware explanations and instant patch suggestions while you are actively coding or reviewing a specific function.

- **Q: Can the AI find logical vulnerabilities, or just syntax-based ones?**
  - A: While it excels at known patterns (like missing sanitization), state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also identify complex business logic flaws if you provide enough context about what the code is _supposed_ to do.

- **Q: Is it safe to paste my company's proprietary code into an AI?**
  - A: Always adhere to your company's data security policy. Avoid pasting hardcoded secrets, API keys, or highly sensitive proprietary algorithms. Consider using an enterprise version of the AI tool that guarantees data privacy, or anonymize the variable names before pasting.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Assignment (White Hat Hacker):** By assigning a specific persona, the AI adopts a security-first mindset, focusing on exploitation and defense rather than just code functionality.
2. **OWASP Top 10 Constraint:** This forces the AI to cross-reference its findings with the industry-standard list of the most critical security risks, ensuring high-priority threats aren't missed.
3. **Scenario-Based Explanation:** Asking for "how it can be attacked" prevents vague warnings and provides tangible educational value, helping the developer truly understand the risk.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Vulnerable PHP Code)

```php
$username = $_POST['user'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" . $username . "'";
$db->query($query);
```

### ✅ After (Diagnosis and Fix)

**🚨 Vulnerability Detected:** **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
If an attacker inputs a malicious string like `' OR '1'='1` into the `$username` field, the resulting query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1'`. This bypasses authentication and exposes the entire user table.

**🛡️ Secure Code (Using Prepared Statements):**

```php
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $_POST['user']);
$stmt->execute();
```

_Explanation: By using `prepare` and `bind_param`, the database engine treats the input strictly as data parameters, rather than executable SQL commands, neutralizing the injection attack completely._

## 🎯 Conclusion

A security breach is a bell that cannot be unrung. Don't wait to become a cautionary tale. Running a quick AI audit on your critical functions takes less than a minute, but it can save you from a catastrophic data leak.

Code smart, deploy safely, and go enjoy your evening! 🍷
