_"Are you saying the transcribed text is 10 pages long after a 1-hour meeting?"_

Meeting recordings or transcripts often contain a lot of spoken language and the content is scattered, making it difficult to grasp the core points when looking at them later. It takes another long time to organize this into a report format.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Solve complex tasks with a single prompt.
2. Immediately applicable to practical work such as Excel, reports, emails, etc.
