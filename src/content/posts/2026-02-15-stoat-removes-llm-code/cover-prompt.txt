A minimalist, futuristic illustration of a sleek, stylized stoat (weasel-like animal) holding a digital eraser or vacuum cleaner. It is erasing glowing, cluttered lines of binary code from a holographic screen, leaving behind a clean, empty space. Dark mode aesthetic, neon purple and cyan accents, clean composition. The background features subtle digital rain or matrix-like code fading away. Focus on the concept of 'cleaning up code' or 'minimalism'.
