## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt doesn't just give you words; it acts as a strategic brainstorming partner. The true magic lies in the "psychological trigger" requirement. When you force the AI to justify _why_ a headline works, it drastically improves the quality of its output, moving away from generic clickbait to genuinely persuasive copy. I highly recommend running this prompt first, picking the best angle, and then building your design around that specific hook—rather than the other way around.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes! The Pro version of the prompt is structured clearly enough that even GPT-3.5 or Gemini Flash can produce excellent results. However, models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o often provide slightly more nuanced emotional triggers.

- **Q: Can I use this for platforms other than Instagram?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just change the `[Informational Carousel/Card News]` variable to something like `[LinkedIn Slider]` or `[Twitter/X Thread]` and the AI will adapt the tone and structure accordingly.
