_"I want to create an image that overwhelms with form and atmosphere rather than details."_

You don't have to show everything. Using **Backlighting** to make the subject a **Silhouette** stimulates the audience's imagination and gives a strong visual impact.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Make the subject black with `Silhouette`, `Backlit` keywords.
2. Background must be a bright light source like `Sunset`, `Bright moon`, `Explosion`.
3. It becomes more sophisticated when used with `Minimalist`, `High contrast`.
