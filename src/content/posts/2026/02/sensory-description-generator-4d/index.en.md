### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need nuanced, high-quality prose with specific tonal shifts.

> **Role:** You are an elite literary writer and a master of atmospheric world-building.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: The sentences I write are too dry and rely too much on "telling" rather than "showing."
> - Goal: I need to rewrite them so readers feel completely immersed in the scene, experiencing it firsthand.
>
> **Input Sentence:** `[e.g., I entered an old abandoned house. It was very dusty and smelled bad.]`
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Rewrite the input sentence into 3 distinct versions, meticulously utilizing the **Five Senses (Visual, Auditory, Olfactory, Tactile, Gustatory)**.
> 2. Tailor each version strictly to the following atmospheres:
>    - **Version A (Horror/Thriller):** Emphasize tension, discomfort, and creeping dread.
>    - **Version B (Emotional/Nostalgic):** Highlight the passage of time, lingering loneliness, and faded memories.
>    - **Version C (Mystery/Fantasy):** Focus on the bizarre, the arcane, and an ethereal, magical aura.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Absolutely NO abstract emotional words (e.g., "scary," "sad," "creepy"). Instead, _induce_ these emotions purely through sensory details.
> - Utilize sophisticated metaphors and similes to elevate the literary quality without being overly verbose.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a game-changer for breaking writer's block, especially during the drafting phase when you just want to get the plot down. Often, writers fall into the trap of summarizing scenes rather than painting them. By forcing the AI to avoid abstract emotional labels like "scary" or "sad," we enforce the "Show, Don't Tell" rule mechanically.

_Pro Tip:_ Don't just copy and paste the AI's output blindly. Use its suggestions as a palette. Take the chilling auditory detail from the Horror version and blend it with the visual texture of the Mystery version to create your own unique, polished prose.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well for modern or sci-fi settings, or is it just for fantasy/horror?**
  - A: It works flawlessly across all genres. Just change the "Atmosphere Options" in the Pro prompt to fit your specific genre, such as "Cyberpunk Grime" or "Sterile Sci-Fi."

- **Q: The AI's metaphors feel a bit too flowery and over-the-top. How can I fix this?**
  - A: Add a constraint to the prompt: `"Use concise, hard-boiled prose similar to Ernest Hemingway. Keep metaphors minimal and grounded."` This will tone down the purple prose while retaining the strong sensory impact.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Banning Abstract Emotions:** By explicitly forbidding words like "scary," the AI is forced to find physical, sensory equivalents (e.g., "a sudden drop in temperature," "the scent of copper and old rot").
2. **Multi-Atmosphere Generation:** Asking for 3 distinct emotional tones from a single input gives you immediate narrative options and highlights how sensory details shift based on context.
3. **Targeted Sensory Engagement:** Explicitly listing the five senses ensures the AI doesn't just focus on visuals, bypassing a common bias in AI text generation.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
The winter sea was cold. The sound of the waves could be heard.
```

### ✅ After (Result - Horror/Thriller Version)

```text
A biting, razor-sharp wind slashed across the face, carrying the metallic sting of frozen salt. The dark, bruising-blue ocean heaved like a wounded beast, violently smashing its foaming maw against the jagged rocks. Beneath the deafening roar of the surf lingered a suffocating stench—the pungent, rotting tang of dead kelp and something long forgotten beneath the surface.
```
