Prompt engineering in 2026 has completely transcended the limitations of text. Models now understand and process image, audio, and video as 'languages' equal to text. We've moved beyond "describe this image" to complex multimodal reasoning.

### Visual Prompting

Beyond simply inputting images, techniques to guide the model's attention by drawing arrows or boxes on images have become standardized. For example, if you circle a specific part of a complex UI screenshot with a red pen and ask, "Make this part more modern," the model generates code with only that specific section updated.

### Audio Prompting

The nuance of voice input has also become a critical prompt element. If a user asks a question in an urgent tone, the model provides a more concise and core answer; if asked in a calm, analytical tone, it responds with a detailed report format. Emotions or intentions difficult to express in text are conveyed within the voice itself.

### Video Context

Using video files themselves as prompts has become routine, enabling requests like "Explain the concept at 15:30 of this lecture video with a different example." This is driving revolutionary productivity gains in education and content creation.
