_"Quantum Mechanics? Theory of Relativity? I can read the letters but can't draw a picture in my head."_

It is said that the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text. The best way to study complex concepts is to understand them with 'pictures'. AI can draw pictures directly (DALL-E, etc.), but for learning purposes, clear structured 'text diagrams' or amazing 'analogies' are often more effective.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Diagram complex systems or structures with ASCII Art (Text pictures)
2. Explain difficult technical terms by comparing them to everyday objects around us (Water, Car, Pizza, etc.)
3. Summarize relationships between components with arrow flowcharts

## 🚀 The Solution: "Mental Model Builder"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you just need a quick result.

> **Role:** You are a `[Science Communicator and Infographic Designer]`.
> **Request:** Create a prompt that draws abstract scientific principles or mathematical concepts with text diagrams (ASCII Art) and analogies.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below and use it.

> **Role:** You are a `[Science Communicator and Infographic Designer]`.
>
> **Context:** I am studying `[Difficult Concept]`, but just looking at the text doesn't draw the structure in my head. Visualize it so I can understand intuitively.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. **[ASCII Diagram]**: Diagram the structure or operating principle of this concept using text symbols (=, -, |, >, [] etc.). (Put it in a code block).
> 2. **[Easy Analogy]**: Explain this concept by comparing it to everyday objects even elementary school students know (Analogy). In the format "A is like B".
> 3. **[Key Relationship]**: Summarize how each component interacts with each other with an arrow (→) flow.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Don't draw the diagram too wide so it doesn't break on mobile.
> - Pick the most perfect fit for the analogy.
>
> **Input Concept:**
> `[Enter the concept you want to visualize here]`

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Explain TCP/IP 3-way Handshake."

### ✅ After (Result)

**[ASCII Diagram]**

```text
  [Client]              [Server]
     |                     |
     |--- (1) SYN -------->|  "Excuse me! Can I talk to you?"
     |                     |
     |<-- (2) SYN+ACK -----|  "Oh sure! I'm ready too."
     |                     |
     |--- (3) ACK -------->|  "Okay, then starting!"
     |                     |
     |==== [Connection] ===|
```

**[Easy Analogy]**
This is like **'Starting a phone call'**.

1. "Hello?" (Can you hear my voice?)
2. "Yes, hello. I can hear you well." (Uh, I hear you. Can you hear me too?)
3. "Yes, then I'll say my business." (Check complete. Main topic starts)

## 🎯 Conclusion

Seeing is believing. If you don't understand, you can't memorize. Draw a map in your head with this prompt.

Now leave work on time and go see an exhibition! 🍷
