## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

Many interviewers struggle because they rely on their gut feeling rather than structured data. This prompt completely changes the game by acting as your personal HR consultant. Whenever I'm assigned to interview a candidate for a role outside my direct expertise, I use this prompt to instantly generate a professional baseline. It not only gives me the right questions to ask but also trains me on what a 'good' answer actually sounds like. Always remember to adjust the `[Resume Summary]` with specific details—the more context you provide, the sharper the AI's questions will be.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use this for entry-level positions or internships?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just add a constraint like "Focus on foundational skills, learning agility, and academic projects rather than extensive industry experience."

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, it works flawlessly. However, advanced models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet will generally provide more nuanced probing questions and a more sophisticated evaluation guide.

- **Q: What if the generated questions are too technical for me to evaluate?**
  - A: You can instruct the AI to "Provide the evaluation guide in layman's terms" or ask it to generate questions that focus more on problem-solving methodologies rather than specific syntax or tools.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the persona of a "Senior HR Interviewer," the AI adopts a professional, discerning, and analytical tone.
2. **Contextual Anchoring:** Feeding the `[Resume Summary]` ensures the questions are tailored specifically to the candidate, preventing generic output.
3. **Behavioral Focus (BEI):** Constraining the AI to use the BEI framework forces candidates to prove their skills through past actions, not theoretical knowledge.
4. **Evaluation Guide:** Asking for a rubric transforms the prompt from a simple question generator into a comprehensive interviewing tool, standardizing your assessment.
