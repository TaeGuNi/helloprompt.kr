_"Is this code the best? I wish someone would look at it..."_

When coding alone, your vision tends to narrow.
If you just let it slide saying "It works, so it's fine," your skills won't improve.
What if a senior developer from a world-class IT company sat next to you and tore apart your code line by line?
From bone-hitting advice to compliments, hire an AI code reviewer.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Apply strict code quality standards like Google/FAANG
2. Multi-angle analysis from security, performance, readability, and architecture perspectives
3. Provide specific feedback with improved code examples

## 🧬 Why it works?

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Code)

```python
def s(x):
    return x * x
```

### ✅ After (Review Result)

**👍 Good:** The function is concise and the purpose is clear.

**🛠 Improvements:**

1. **Naming:** Function name `s` and argument `x` give no information. `square` or `calculate_square` would be better.
2. **Type Hinting:** It would be good to use Python's type hints to specify that input and output are numbers.
3. **Docstring:** Function description is missing.

**🤔 Questions:**
What happens if a string instead of a number is entered as an input? Have you considered error handling?

**✨ Refactoring:**

```python
def calculate_square(number: float) -> float:
    """Returns the square of a given number."""
    return number ** 2
```
