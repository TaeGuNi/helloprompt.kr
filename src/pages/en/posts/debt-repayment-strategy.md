### 📉 Debt Repayment Strategy Proposal: 'Avalanche Strategy' (Interest Saving Priority)

**1. Recommended Strategy: Avalanche Method**
Since Card Loan rate is very high at 18%, interest will snowball if left alone. Strongly recommend turning off high rate loan first for **"Interest Cost Minimization"** rather than psychological satisfaction.

**2. Repayment Priority**
1. 🥇 **Loan A (Card Loan):** Rate 18% (Most urgent!)
2. 🥈 **Loan C (Credit Loan):** Rate 6%
3. 🥉 **Loan B (Jeonse Loan):** Rate 4%

**3. Simulation (Repaying 1.5M Monthly)**
- **Step 1:** If you go all-in 1.5M on Loan A (3M), **Full payment possible in about 2~3 months**.
- **Effect:** High rate bad debt disappears in just 3 months, and credit score will rise. After that, focus 1.5M on Loan C repayment.
