In 2026, software development has fundamentally shifted. We no longer just write code; we curate it with the help of intelligent agents. One of the most impactful areas of this revolution is **AI-Driven Refactoring**.

## The Legacy Code Challenge
For decades, "legacy code" was a scary term. It meant code without tests, written by developers who left years ago, full of hidden dependencies. Refactoring it was risky.

## How AI Changes the Game
AI agents now understand context. They don't just match regex; they understand data flow, variable scope, and architectural intent.
1. **Automated Test Generation**: Before touching a line of code, AI generates comprehensive regression tests to ensure safety.
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying "God Classes" or "Spaghetti Code" is instant.
3. **Semantic Transformation**: AI refactors for readability and performance while preserving logic.

## The Human Role
Despite these advancements, the human developer remains the architect. We define the *goal* of the refactoring (e.g., "prepare this module for microservices"), and the AI executes the tactical changes.

## Conclusion
Refactoring is no longer a chore—it is a continuous, automated process that keeps our codebases healthy and ready for the future.
