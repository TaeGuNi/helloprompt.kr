_"I talked to Guard A passing by... what's his name? Personality?"_

Players are always interested in NPCs the master hasn't prepared. Saying "Uh... just a guard" breaks immersion. Here is a magic spell to instantly create living, breathing NPCs.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input only the NPC's job or role.
2. AI generates a name, physical features, tone of voice, and a **'trivial habit'**.
3. Add a **'secret'** or **'desire'** to give the NPC depth.
