_"A peaceful country ruled by a king... but who collects taxes? What about the army?"_

Even in a fantasy novel, immersion breaks if political and economic systems are flimsy. Like Game of Thrones or Dune, let's design a multi-dimensional nation entangled in power struggles and interests.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input the nation's geographical location and major resources.
2. AI suggests a matching political system (Monarchy, Republic, Theocracy, etc.) and power structure.
3. Generates internal conflicts and external threats to heighten story tension.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Desert country. Has a king."

### ✅ After (Result)

- **Nation Name:** **Al-Sarah Federation**
- **System:** **Oasis Oligarchy**. 7 chieftains ruling 7 massive oases take turns serving as the 'High Chieftain'.
- **Ruling Class:** 'Water Keepers' Guild. They effectively hold more power than the king as they control the water supply.
- **Conflict:** As underground waterways dry up, civil war looms between northern tribes trying to monopolize water and southern merchants trying to stop them.
