_"If I studied during the time making cards, I would have gone to Seoul National University."_

Flashcard apps (Anki etc.) are the best memorization tools, but they have a fatal drawback. The 'manual labor' of making cards (front/back) is too hard. Memorizing takes 10 minutes but making cards takes 1 hour. Now leave that labor to AI.
