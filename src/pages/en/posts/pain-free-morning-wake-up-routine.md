_"Is waking up in the morning like hell? Changing the way you wake up changes the energy of your day."_

Right after waking up, the brain is blank due to 'sleep inertia'. If you force yourself to get up at this time, the stress hormone cortisol spikes. Receive a **scientific wake-up blueprint** through AI that gently wakes up your brain and makes you kick the blanket with excitement.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1.  Inform the 3-step sequence (Light -> Water -> Movement) to wake up the brain immediately after waking up.
2.  Remove sleep inertia with simple stretching you can do in bed.
3.  Implant clear motivation (pleasure) to wake up in the morning into the routine.
