_"Imjin War broke out in 1592... I hate memorizing. Can't I fight myself?"_

History is not a dead record, but the result of fierce 'choices' of people at that time. Rather than simply memorizing, if you stand at that decisive moment and worry, the causal relationship of history is understood painfully. This prompt turns textbooks into **RPG Games**.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Textbook)

"In Battle of Myeongnyang, Yi Sun-sin defeated 133 Japanese ships with 13 ships. (Using current of Uldolmok)"

### ✅ After (Prompt Game)

**[Situation]**
You are Commander Yi Sun-sin. Only 13 ships remain. Far away on the horizon, the Japanese fleet is rushing in full. Subordinates are trembling with fear.

**[Options]**
A. "Those who seek to live shall die!" Order all forces to sortie.
B. Retreat for now and wage guerrilla warfare on land.
C. Ambush enemy supply ships taking advantage of night.

**(User Choice: B)**

**[Result]**
You abandoned ships and fled to land. Joseon navy was annihilated, and Japanese forces go around West Sea and deliver supplies directly to Hanyang. The tide of war tilted completely to Japanese forces... (Bad Ending)

**[Historical Fact]**
Actual Admiral Yi Sun-sin chose A. He achieved a miraculous victory using narrow terrain and current of Uldolmok. Your choice (B) was the method King Seonjo wanted at the time, but if so, Joseon might have fallen.
