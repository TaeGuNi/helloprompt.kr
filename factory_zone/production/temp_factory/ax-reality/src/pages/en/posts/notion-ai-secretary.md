# 🧠 Notion AI Secretary: Daily To-Do Sorting & Auto-Scheduling

**🎯 Recommended for:** People spacing out with too many tasks, People whose plans are only pretty on paper

- **⏱️ Time Required:** 1 min
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** Notion AI (Paid but powerful) or ChatGPT (Copy-paste)

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility  |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
|   ⭐☆☆☆☆   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ |

_"Ah right, laundry... oh need to email boss... wait, when is the meeting today?"_

When your brain is like tangled yarn, productivity drops to zero. The core of **GTD (Getting Things Done)** is **"Get it out of your head and write it down"**. Just dump it. Notion AI will organize it. Introducing the 'Mindless Scheduling' technique: Empty your brain, outsource to AI.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1.  Write EVERYTHING (including chores) on a Notion page. (Order doesn't matter)
2.  Press `Spacebar` to call AI. (Or paste to ChatGPT)
3.  Command: **"Sort this by priority"**.

---

## 🚀 Solution: "Auto-Scheduler Prompt"

### 🥉 Basic Version (Simple List Sort)

Using Notion AI feature (`Space` key).

> **Brain Dump (Input):**
>
> - Write report
> - Call Mom
> - Buy toothpaste
> - Dev team meeting prep
> - 3pm Dentist
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Classify above into **[Urgent/Important]**, **[Chores]**, **[Work]**, and rewrite as a Checkbox List in execution order."

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Eisenhower Matrix & Timetable)

Using ChatGPT to make a perfect daily plan.

- **Role:** You are the best Time Management Coach.
  > **Input (My Tasks):**
  > `[List random tasks here]`
  >
  > **Task:**
  >
  > 1. Classify into **Eisenhower Matrix** (4 Quadrants).
  >    - Do Now (Important/Urgent)
  >    - Schedule (Important/Not Urgent)
  >    - Delegate (Urgent/Not Important)
  >    - Delete (Not Important/Not Urgent)
- 2. Based on this, create a **Timeline for Today**. (Include Lunch 12-1pm)
     > 3. Add estimated time and a **'Focus Tip'** for each task.

## 🧬 Anatomy of Prompt (Why it works?)

1.  **Eisenhower Matrix:** Let AI judge the weight of tasks. We often mistake 'Buy toothpaste' as equal to 'Write report'.
2.  **Timeline Visualization:** A list is not enough. You need to stamp "14:00~15:00 Write Report" to move your body.
