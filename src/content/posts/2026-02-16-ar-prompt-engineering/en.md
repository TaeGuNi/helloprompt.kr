## 2026, A New Horizon for Spatial Computing

As of February 2026, with the launch of Apple's Vision Pro 3, we are living in the era of true Spatial Computing. While hardware advancements are astonishing, at the core lies the evolution of **Prompt Engineering** connecting AI and AR (Augmented Reality). If traditional text-based prompts were for 2D screens, 'Spatial Prompts' that control 3-dimensional space have now become a core competency.

### Vision Pro 3 and Multimodal Prompting

Vision Pro 3 offers a sophisticated multimodal interface that simultaneously recognizes user gaze, hand gestures, and voice. Accordingly, prompt engineering must also understand complex contexts.

*   **Eye Tracking-based Context Injection:** A technique that automatically includes the metadata of the object the user is looking at as context for the prompt.
    *   *Example:* When saying "Fix this," the 3D model information of the furniture the gaze rests on is sent to the LLM.
*   **Gesture-to-Action Mapping:** Simplifying complex commands by setting specific hand movements as prompt triggers.

### Prompt Structure for 3D Object Generation

When generating or modifying 3D assets in real-time within an AR environment, the prompt structure must be very specific.

```markdown
[Object Definition] + [Spatial Constraints] + [Physical Properties] + [Interaction Definition]
```

*   **Object Definition:** "Vintage style wooden chair"
*   **Spatial Constraints:** "Place in the 50cm space to the right of my desk, same height as the desk"
*   **Physical Properties:** "Apply gravity, high surface friction coefficient (non-slip)"
*   **Interaction:** "Highlight when user approaches"

### Spatial Awareness and AI Agents

Going beyond simple command execution, AI agents within AR glasses must be 'aware' of the surrounding environment. For this, **Environment Anchoring** prompts are used.

> "Analyze the lighting conditions in the living room and place virtual frames on the wall that match the current mood. However, use modern frames so they do not clash with existing furniture styles."

This prompt requires a complex reasoning process: ① Lighting analysis ② Space scanning ③ Style matching, rather than simple image generation.

### Future Prompt Engineers: Becoming Spatial Designers

Now, prompt engineers must possess not just writing skills, but the sensibility of a designer who understands and plans space. Vision Pro 3 is just the starting point, and AR prompt engineering will establish itself as a new specialized field fusing architecture, game design, and psychology.

We are now writing prompts that use the world itself as a canvas, moving beyond rectangular screens. What space will your next prompt create?
