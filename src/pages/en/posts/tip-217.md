_"I'm a perfectionist so I'm a tiring style... (Interviewer: That story again)"_

The weakness question is not intended to fail you, but to see **'if you have self-objectification'** and **'if you have the will to improve'**. You need 'sophisticated honesty' by choosing a non-fatal weakness and presenting it with your efforts to overcome it.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Find a weakness subject that is not fatal (Non-fatal) to job performance.
2. Briefly mention past problem situations caused by the weakness.
3. Emphasize what efforts you are currently making to compensate for this (Solution).

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Fatal Honesty)

```text
"I sleep in a lot in the morning so I'm often late. But I will fix it."
(Doubt sincerity -> Immediate Fail)
```

### ✅ After (Emphasize Effort to Overcome)

```text
"I often missed other requests when immersed in one task. (Admit Weakness)
To compensate for this, I developed a habit of prioritizing work orders every morning using a Notion 'Priority Matrix'. (Concrete Solution)
As a result, I now meet deadlines without missing any tasks even in multitasking situations. (Improvement Result)"
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

No one is perfect. The interviewer knows that too. A person who knows their deficiencies and fills them is much more attractive than a person who hides them.

Use your weakness as a stepping stone to acceptance! 🧗
