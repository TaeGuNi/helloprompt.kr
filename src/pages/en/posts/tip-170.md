_"Don't be fooled by the trap of simple averages. Real growth must be calculated with compound interest."_

When reporting company revenue growth or stock portfolio returns, simply calculating `(Final - Initial) / Initial` creates distortion. The correct answer is **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**, which represents the rate of steady growth every year. Ask AI, and it will give you the Excel formula right away without needing to know complex math formulas.

## ⚡️ TL;DR
