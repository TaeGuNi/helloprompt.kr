# 📝 No More Spaghetti Code! Architecture Recommendations for My Project

> **🎯 Recommended for:** Everyone
> **⏱️ Time required:** 5 minutes
> **🤖 Recommended model:** All AI models

_"It was simple at first... but after adding a few features, the code got mixed up and I'm scared to modify it."_

Every large-scale project started with a single small file.
But if you start without a structure, you will soon fall into the swamp of 'Technical Debt'.
Request a design blueprint (architecture) perfectly suited to the nature of your project from AI. It will be a sturdy skeleton.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Recommend architecture patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.) suitable for project requirements
2. Define Directory Structure and file roles
3. Analyze pros and cons of adoption

## 🚀 Solution: "Software Architect"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a Chief Software Architect in charge of large-scale system design.
> **Request:** Provide a prompt that designs the optimal software architecture such as MVC, Clean Architecture, or MSA when project size and requirements are input.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a Chief Software Architect in charge of large-scale system design.
>
> **Context:** I'm about to start a new project, and I'm wondering which architecture to apply for easy maintenance and scalability.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Recommend 2 **most suitable architecture patterns** considering the characteristics of my project.
> 2. Based on the #1 recommended architecture, draw the **Directory Structure** in a tree format.
> 3. Explain the role of each folder and Layer.
>
> **Project Description:**
> `[Write project details. e.g., Shopping mall app with many users, using React Native and Node.js, Payment and Delivery tracking features are important]`
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Avoid Over-engineering and propose according to realistic scale.
> - Provide logical reasons why you chose this architecture.

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Project)

"I'm going to make a simple To-Do app. Developing alone and not many features."

### ✅ After (Result)

**Recommended Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** or **Feature-based Structure**

**Folder Structure (Feature-based):**

```text
src/
├── features/           # Modules by feature
│   ├── todos/
│   │   ├── components/ # Todo UI
│   │   ├── hooks/      # Todo Logic
│   │   └── api/        # Todo API calls
│   └── auth/           # Auth related
├── shared/             # Common modules
│   ├── components/     # Common buttons, inputs
│   └── utils/          # Utility functions
├── App.js
└── index.js
```

_Reason: Since the project is small, grouping by Feature is more intuitive and faster to develop than complex layer separation._

## 🎯 Conclusion

No one builds a house by stacking bricks without a blueprint.
Software is no different. Build a sturdy house that won't collapse even after 10 years with an AI Architect! 🍷
