_"Do you all have a dream of publishing a book under your name? But 'how to organize' is harder than 'what to write'."_

80% of writing a book is the table of contents. If the table of contents is solid, the manuscript writes itself. Plan an attractive table of contents that publishing editors will fall for and readers will want to buy with AI.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. The biggest barrier to book writing is the vagueness of 'how to organize'.
