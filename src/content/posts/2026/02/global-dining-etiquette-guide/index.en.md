What feels completely natural at home can easily become a major faux pas abroad. Conversely, actions like burping or slurping—often frowned upon in many Western cultures—might actually be genuine compliments to the chef in other parts of the world. Before you embark on your next international trip or business dinner, use this prompt to seamlessly adapt to local dining etiquette and impress your hosts.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Navigating cross-cultural dining can be a minefield, especially during international business trips where impressing your clients is crucial. I've found that using this prompt before a trip not only saves me from embarrassment but also shows immense respect to my hosts. The key here is the `[Occasion]` variable in the Pro Version. Eating street food in Thailand requires a vastly different set of rules than attending a formal Kaiseki dinner in Kyoto. By adjusting the context, this prompt acts as your personalized cultural attaché.

  - A: Absolutely. You can modify the context to include: "I am vegetarian. How do I politely decline meat dishes or ask about ingredients without offending the host?"

## 🧬 Prompt Dissection (Why it works?)

1. **Contextual Specificity:** By defining the exact country and dining occasion, the AI filters out generic advice and provides highly targeted, actionable cultural norms.
2. **Focus on Taboos:** Asking specifically for 'Absolute Taboos' prevents catastrophic cultural mistakes that could offend hosts or business partners.
3. **Actionable Deliverables:** Requesting specific phrases and utensil rules gives you practical tools you can immediately apply at the table, rather than just abstract cultural theory.
