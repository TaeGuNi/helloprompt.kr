"OO, thanks for reaching out. Your situation seems urgent. I really wish I could help, but I'm also in a difficult spot with loan repayments right now, so it's hard for me to spare any funds. I'm really sorry I can't grant a close friend's request. I sincerely hope your situation gets resolved well."
