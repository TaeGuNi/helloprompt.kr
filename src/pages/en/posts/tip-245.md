_"A child who cries louder when you say no, are you tired of trying to persuade them with logic?"_

A tantrum-throwing child's brain is currently in an 'emotional explosion' state. Rational explanations won't be heard. Ask AI for a 3-step conversation method: first read their emotions (Mirroring), calm them down, and then suggest alternatives.
