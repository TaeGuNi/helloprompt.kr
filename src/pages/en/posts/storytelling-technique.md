_"Is the information accurate but boring, leading to a high bounce rate? If you add Emotion to Fact, readers will read to the end."_

The sentence "Our company was founded in 1990" is boring. But "In 1990, there was a reckless challenge that started in a small garage" arouses curiosity. Ask AI to perform the magic of turning plain information into living stories.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
(Same as Original Text above)
Diet control is important for dieting. Exercise alone won't work. No late-night snacks. Willpower is essential.
```

<br>

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
At 11 PM, I look at my finger repeatedly turning the delivery app on and off.
I ran on the treadmill sweating for an hour at the gym,
but in front of the temptation of the smell of fried chicken, that effort feels like foam bubbles.

Many of you will empathize.
The sweet rationalization of 'I exercised, so this much is okay?', right?
But unfortunately, our bodies react more honestly to the time we endured without eating than the time we exercised.

Tonight, try enduring that desperate desire to open the refrigerator door just once.
Because tomorrow morning, you will face a slightly lighter and slightly firmer self in the mirror.
```
