## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

Creating landing page copy often falls into the trap of "we-centric" writing—focusing too much on what the company does rather than what the user gets. This prompt is engineered to force the AI into a "you-centric" mindset. By explicitly requiring the _Customer's Pain Point_ and demanding _concrete benefits_, the AI bypasses generic marketing fluff.

_Pro Tip:_ I highly recommend testing the "Problem-Solving Type" output first. Agitating a specific pain point in the headline ("Still doing X manually?") almost always outperforms generic benefit statements in initial A/B tests.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with the free version of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/GPT-4o-mini)?**
  - A: Yes, the basic structure will work fine. However, for nuanced, emotionally resonant copy that truly sounds like a seasoned UX writer, Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o will yield significantly better, more natural-sounding results.

- **Q: What if the generated copy feels too "salesy"?**
  - A: Simply add a constraint to the prompt: `Use a conversational, empathetic tone. Avoid aggressive sales jargon.` You can also specify the exact brand voice you want (e.g., `Tone: Playful and witty like Mailchimp`).

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing (CRO Expert):** Instructing the AI to act as a Conversion Rate Optimization expert shifts its output from generic text generation to performance-driven copywriting.
2. **Structural Enforcement:** By forcing the output into a specific trio (Headline + Sub-headline + CTA), you ensure the AI delivers a complete, structurally sound Hero Section rather than a disjointed paragraph.
3. **Anti-Buzzword Constraint:** The specific instruction to avoid words like "Innovative" and instead use concrete numbers is the secret sauce here. AI models love using fluffy adjectives; this constraint forces them to be precise and persuasive.
