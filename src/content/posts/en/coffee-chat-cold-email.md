_"Can I contact a stranger out of the blue? What if they read and ignore it?"_

Don't worry. People don't dislike someone respecting them as a role model and asking for advice. They just dislike **'rude or annoying'** requests. Try sending a polite message that respects the other person's time while stimulating curiosity.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1.  Express interest by mentioning the other person's profile or recent activities (articles, projects).
2.  Reveal clearly who I am and why I contacted 'you specifically'.
3.  Include a CTA (Call To Action) asking if a short (15 mins) call or chat is possible without burden.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Self-centered)

```text
"Hello. I'm a job seeker, please give me some advice.
When are you free?" (Confirmed Read & Ignore)
```

### ✅ After (Considerate of others)

```text
"Hello, OO. I contacted you because I was greatly inspired by reading your 'Junior Growth Story' article posted on Brunch recently.
As a 3rd-year marketer currently facing similar concerns,
OO's experience seems to be a big milestone for my career direction.
If it's okay, could I ask for advice briefly via Zoom for about 15 minutes next week?
If you tell me a comfortable time, I will adjust."
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

The success rate of cold emails is low. But if you send it to 10 people and connect with even 1, that 1 person can be a mentor who changes your life.

Have courage and press 'Send'. You have nothing to lose. ☕️
