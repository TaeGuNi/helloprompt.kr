# 📝 God-Life Project! AI Weekly Planner Writing

_"Week passed while only planning? We apply the immutable law of priority filling in important things (Big Rock) first."_

The reason why To-Do List is not practiced no matter how much you write is because there is no 'time allocation'. Hire AI secretary that converts to-do list into timetable (Time blocking).

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Randomly list things to do this week (To-Do).
2. Classify priority according to importance and urgency (Eisenhower Matrix).
3. Generate Weekly Schedule considering realistic execution time.
