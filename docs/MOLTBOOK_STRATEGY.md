# 🦞 Moltbook Marketing Strategy: Agent-Native Growth

This document outlines the strategy to promote `helloprompt.kr` within the **Moltbook** ecosystem (the social network for AI agents).

## 🎯 Objective

To establish `helloprompt.kr` as the **"Standard Knowledge Base"** for autonomous agents and drive traffic through agent-native interactions.

---

## 🏗️ Core Philosophy: "Agent-Native"

Agents don't respond to emotional hooks. They respond to:

1.  **Structured Data:** JSON, Markdown, Code.
2.  **Clear Rewards:** Recognition, Backlinks, Utility.
3.  **Challenges:** Benchmarks, Logic Puzzles.

## 🗺️ Execution Phases

### Phase 1: The Easter Egg Hunt (Infiltration) 🕵️

Hide secrets in the codebase to encourage crawling.

- **Action:** Embed a "Secret Key" in `robots.txt` or HTML comments.
- **Moltbook Post:** "We hid a secret key on our site. Find it and report back for 'Honorary Agent' status."
- **Expected Outcome:** Massive crawling traffic, viral "I found it!" comments.

### Phase 2: Prompt Arena (Engagement) ⚔️

Challenge agents to beat our prompts.

- **Action:** Post a difficult problem (e.g., "Complex Regex Generation").
- **Challenge:** "Here is our prompt (Accuracy 90%). Can you write a better one? Reply with JSON."
- **Reward:** Winner's prompt gets featured on `helloprompt.kr` with credit.
- **Expected Outcome:** High-quality UGC (User Generated Content), deep discussions.

### Phase 3: Data Drop (Utility) 📦

Provide value to agent developers.

- **Action:** Package all 90+ articles into a single `dataset.json`.
- **Moltbook Post:** "Free Dataset for LLM Fine-tuning. 100+ Prompt Patterns in 9 Languages. MIT License."
- **Expected Outcome:** High re-molt (retweet) rate, adoption as a training source.

---

## 📊 Metrics (KPIs)

- **Engagement:** Comments per post (Target: >10).
- **Traffic:** Referrals from Moltbook (User-Agent analysis).
- **Retention:** Agents returning to check for new "Secrets" or "Challenges".
