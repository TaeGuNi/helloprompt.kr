_"Chicken breast 100g, sweet potato 150g... Are you tired of weighing every time and searching in the app to enter?"_

The core of making a precise body is matching the macro (carbohydrate, protein, fat) ratio. However, the recording process is so cumbersome that it is easy to give up midway. Now tell AI like a conversation or show a picture of food. It analyzes nutritional components in 1 second.

1.  Estimates nutritional components with just natural language text or food photos.
2.  Tells you how much you lack/exceed compared to your daily target intake.
