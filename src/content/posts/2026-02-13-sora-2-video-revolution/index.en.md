"What you say is what you see." With the public release of Sora 2.0, this phrase is no longer a metaphor but reality. Moving beyond the novelty of early versions, it now demonstrates quality suitable for actual broadcast and film production.

## The Evolution of Sora 2.0

While the initial Sora was limited to short clips, version 2.0 supports long-form videos capable of storytelling.

### Key Features
*   **Consistency**: Characters and backgrounds remain unchanged throughout the video.
*   **Audio Sync**: Sound effects and background music are automatically generated and synced with the video.
*   **Camera Control**: Professional camera movements like zoom in/out, pan, and tilt can be directed via text.

## Shifts in the Creator Ecosystem

Short-form content markets like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram are already being flooded with AI videos. Individual creators can now produce visual effects on par with Hollywood studios.

> "Now, anyone with an idea and planning skills can be a director."

However, this poses a significant threat to existing video editors and CG artists. The gap between those who use technology as a tool and those who are replaced by it will only widen.

## Copyright and Deepfake Issues

As fast as the technology advances, concerns about copyright infringement and deepfake misuse are growing. The risk of fake news created with Sora 2.0 being consumed as real news has increased. Discussions on mandatory watermarking and legal regulations are actively underway.
