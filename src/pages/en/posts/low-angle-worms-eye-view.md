_"I want to make the character look stronger and greater."_

**Low Angle** (or **Worm's Eye View**), attaching the camera to the ground and looking up, makes the subject look huger, more threatening, and authoritative than actual. Essential when expressing heroes, monsters, or buildings.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Use `Low angle shot`, `Worm's eye view`.
2. Clarify gaze processing with `Looking up` keyword.
