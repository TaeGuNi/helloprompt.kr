## 💡 Writer's Insight

Naming is often a bottleneck in product development because it's highly subjective. What makes this prompt so effective is the **"Style Categorization"** and **"Evoked Image"** constraints.

When you just ask an AI for "10 names," it usually gives you very generic or overly literal results (like "SoftDog Shampoo"). By forcing the AI to categorize styles (Metaphorical vs. Intuitive) and explain the _image_ it evokes, you transform the AI from a simple word-spinner into a strategic branding partner.

_Pro Tip:_ Once you find a name you like, don't stop there. Run a follow-up prompt: _"Take the name [Selected Name] and give me 5 variations of it, along with a matching catchy tagline."_ Always remember to do a quick Google and trademark database search (like the USPTO) immediately after picking your top 3!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Which AI model is best for this specific prompt?**
  - A: Claude 3.5 Sonnet currently excels at creative writing and nuanced wordplay, often producing more "human-sounding" and less cliché names than GPT-4o. However, both will yield excellent results with the Pro Version.

- **Q: How can I ensure the names generated aren't already trademarked?**
  - A: AI cannot reliably search live trademark databases. Treat the AI's output as an initial brainstorming list. You must manually verify your favorites through your local trademark office (e.g., USPTO, WIPO) or consult a trademark attorney.

- **Q: What if the AI gives me names that sound too "robotic" or generic?**
  - A: This usually happens if your 'Brand Tone & Manner' is too vague. Instead of just saying "modern," try being hyper-specific: "Sounds like a high-end Scandinavian skincare brand, minimalistic and slightly mysterious."

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Elite Persona:** Assigning the "20 years of global agency experience" role forces the AI to bypass beginner-level suggestions and access its training data related to professional branding case studies.
2. **Structured Inputs:** By explicitly separating 'Features', 'Audience', and 'Tone', the AI has a solid multidimensional matrix to base its creative combinations on.
3. **Format Constraint (Markdown Table):** This makes it incredibly easy to scan, compare, and present the options directly to stakeholders without needing to reformat the output.
