_"What did you do during your gap?"_

Is this the question you dread the most? A gap period is not a sin. What matters is **how you define that time**. Explain logically with AI that it was 'exploration' not wandering, and 'preparation for a leap' not stagnation.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. List activities during the gap period (study, travel, reading, etc.).
2. Connect how those activities had a positive influence (insight, attitude change) on the applied job.
3. Generate an answer with the nuance of "I rested but I am ready".

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Passive Answer)

```text
"Ah... My previous job was too hard so I quit and rested for a while.
I traveled a bit... and time passed while sorting out my thoughts." (Looks exhausted)
```

### ✅ After (Positive Reinterpretation)

```text
"The past 6 months were a 'run-up' time to go further.
I recovered the energy drained from running without rest at my previous job through travel,
and especially cultivated a flexible mindset necessary for [Target Job] by experiencing various cultures.
Thanks to this period, I am now ready to immerse myself 200% in work without worrying about burnout."
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

A gap in life is a **comma**, not a period. Interviewers are people, not robots, so they nod at honest and confident reasons for rest.

Show that your comma has become the driving force to start the next sentence more vigorously. 🌿
