## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Human Eye)

"Hmm... Sales are highest in 2024. End."

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

**[Fact Check]**

- In Q3 2024, sales **surged 45%** compared to previous quarter, recording all-time high ($1.2M).
- On the other hand, operating profit margin **rather fell** from 15% to 8% during the same period.

**[Insight]**

1. **Outer Splendor Inner Poverty**: Sales volume grew, but failed to gain substance (profit margin) due to excessive marketing spending etc.
2. **Seasonality**: Pattern of sales dropping in Q4 repeats every year, so preparation for upcoming winter season is needed.

**[Trap Caution]**

- Y-axis of graph starts from $800k not 0, exaggerating small sales fluctuations to look like huge crash. Be careful.

**[Expected Question]**
"Team Leader: Sales increased but why did profit halve? Did you analyze promotion efficiency?"
