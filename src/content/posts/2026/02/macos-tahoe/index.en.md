> _"Tired of your windows resizing accidentally every time your mouse brushes the edge in macOS Tahoe? Let's get Apple's attention with a perfectly structured UX feedback report."_

With the release of macOS Tahoe, the most debated feature is undoubtedly "Intelligent Edge." Instead of precise pixel-level cursor changes, AI predicts your intent when hovering near a window edge. While Apple calls it the "future of computing," designers and developers are complaining about accidental resizing and the lack of a toggle to revert to the old behavior. If you're frustrated, writing a highly structured feedback report is your best bet to demand a toggle.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. macOS Tahoe's "Intelligent Edge" relies on AI prediction, causing accidental window resizing.
2. Power users and designers are demanding a toggle to restore legacy pixel-perfect behavior.
3. Use this prompt to generate a professional, persuasive Apple Feedback report that engineers can't ignore.

## 🚀 Solution: "Apple Feedback Radar Generator"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need a quick, straightforward report.

> **Role:** You are a UX Expert.
> **Task:** Write a concise bug report to Apple about macOS Tahoe's "Intelligent Edge" window resizing feature. Request a toggle to disable it.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need a highly detailed, professional report that speaks Apple's internal engineering language.

> **Role (Persona):** You are a Senior macOS Developer and UX Architect.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: macOS Tahoe introduced "Intelligent Edge" for AI-predicted window resizing.
> - Issue: It severely impacts precise pointer control, causing accidental resizing for power users utilizing multiple monitors or design tools like Figma and Xcode.
> - Goal: Submit a compelling Apple Feedback (Radar) report demanding a System Settings toggle to disable this feature.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Structure the feedback using Apple's standard Bug Reporter format (Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs. Actual Results).
> 2. Maintain a professional, objective, yet urgent tone emphasizing productivity loss.
> 3. Leave `[Specific App You Use]` as a placeholder for me to fill in later.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Format the output in clean Markdown.
> - Keep the report under 300 words to ensure it is read quickly by Apple triage engineers.
>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Do not include emotional rants or hyperbole; focus purely on the objective UX degradation.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is highly effective because Apple engineers prioritize structured, reproducible bug reports over generalized complaints on forums. By framing the "Intelligent Edge" issue as a direct "productivity loss in professional workflows" rather than just a minor annoyance, your feedback is far more likely to be escalated to the macOS window management engineering team.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does Apple actually read these feedback reports?**
  - A: Yes. Duplicated radars (multiple users reporting the exact same structured issue) directly increase the priority of a bug or feature request in Apple's internal tracking system.
- **Q: Can I use this prompt for other macOS bugs?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just update the `Context` and `Issue` sections to describe your specific bug, and the AI will adapt the structure accordingly.

## 🧬 Anatomy of the Prompt (Why it works?)

1. **Role Assignment:** Adopting the persona of a "Senior macOS Developer" ensures the generated text uses the correct technical terminology (e.g., _precise pointer control_, _System Settings toggle_).
2. **Format Constraints:** Mimicking Apple's internal standard Radar format makes it effortless for their QA and triage teams to process your request without having to parse a wall of text.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Manual Input)

```text
Apple, please fix the new window resizing in Tahoe. It's terrible and my windows keep changing size when I don't want them to. Give us a toggle to turn it off!
```

### ✅ After (AI Output)

```text
**Description:**
"Intelligent Edge" in macOS Tahoe introduces aggressive intent-prediction for window resizing, overriding explicit pixel-level cursor positioning. This causes severe productivity loss and unintended layout shifts in precision-heavy applications like [Specific App You Use].

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open [Specific App You Use] on macOS Tahoe.
2. Attempt to select a UI element near the edge of the application window.
3. Observe the AI incorrectly predicting a resize intent.

**Expected Result:**
A System Settings toggle under "Desktop & Dock" to restore legacy deterministic window resizing.

**Actual Result:**
Unpredictable, AI-driven window resizing with no system-level opt-out mechanism.
```
