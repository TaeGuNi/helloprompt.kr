_"Grammarly fixes it, but my skills don't improve because I move on without knowing why it was fixed."_

Spell checkers only throw results. "This is wrong, change to this." But we are curious about "Why?". You need to know the reason why you should use `in` instead of preposition `at`, or why you should remove `the` so you don't get it wrong next time. This prompt kindly explains the reason like a red pen teacher.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"I look forward to hear from you soon." (Common mistake)

### ✅ After (Result)

**[Revised Version]**
"I look forward to **hearing** from you soon."

**[Correction Note]**

- **To hear → To hearing**: Here 'to' in 'look forward to' is not an infinitive but a **Preposition**. A noun or gerund (-ing) must come after a preposition, so 'hearing' is correct.

**[Native Expression]**

1. "I hope to hear from you soon." (A bit more casual)
2. "Your prompt response would be appreciated." (More formal)
