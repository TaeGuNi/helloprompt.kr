_"Are you exhausted from lining up at tourist spots everyone goes to?"_

True rest depends on 'what you don't do' rather than 'what you do'. Instead of a tight schedule, plan a 1-week healing trip filled with time for yourself.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1.  Itinerary focused on 'experience' and 'rest' rather than sightseeing
2.  The leisure of digesting only one main schedule a day
3.  Recommendation of refreshing activities such as meditation, walking, and reading
