## 💡 Writer's Insight

Writing a Job Description is essentially B2C copywriting, where the "product" is the job and the "customer" is the applicant. When using this prompt, the quality of the `[Brief Company Introduction / Mission]` you provide will make or break the output. Don't just write "We make an app." Write "We are building a fintech app that saves freelancers 10 hours a week on accounting." The more specific you are about your mission, the better the AI can tailor the tone to attract candidates who resonate with your exact goals. I highly recommend using Claude for this specific task, as it naturally excels at nuanced, empathetic copywriting compared to other models.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Should I use ChatGPT or Claude for this?**
  - A: While both work beautifully, Claude 3.5 Sonnet tends to produce more natural, less "robotic" copy for HR and branding purposes. It captures the subtle nuances of employer branding exceptionally well.

- **Q: What if the AI generates skills that are too advanced for the salary we offer?**
  - A: AI tends to aim high. Simply add a constraint to the prompt like: _"Target mid-level professionals with 3-5 years of experience, keeping the required skills realistic and focused on core competencies rather than a 'unicorn' wishlist."_

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Injection:** By defining the AI as a "Startup Recruitment Branding Expert," we shift its vocabulary from standard HR jargon to modern, growth-oriented language.
2. **The WIIFM Constraint:** Forcing the AI to focus on "What's In It For Me" fundamentally changes the JD from a demanding checklist to a persuasive value proposition.
3. **Banning Clichés:** Explicitly forbidding lazy phrases forces the AI to articulate actual, meaningful cultural benefits that candidates care about.
