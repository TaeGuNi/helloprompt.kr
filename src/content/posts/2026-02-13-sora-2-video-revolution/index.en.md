## 💡 Writer's Insight

What surprised me most while using Sora 2.0 is the **'Revival of Directing'**. If version 1.0 was close to a random box, 2.0 reflects the director's (user's) intent quite accurately.

**Tips:**
1.  **Study Camera Terminology:** Using terms like 'Pan', 'Tilt', 'Dolly', 'Truck' makes a significant difference in the result.
2.  **Audio Prompts are Important too:** Describing auditory information (sound of rain, murmuring crowds, etc.) in detail along with visual information doubles the immersion.
3.  **Ethical Use:** Generated videos include a C2PA watermark. Do not remove this or deceive others into thinking it's real footage. Remember that malicious use of deepfakes is subject to legal punishment.
