1.  **Positive Reinforcement:** Explicitly asking for this method prevents AI from suggesting outdated dominance/punishment techniques.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Vague Question)

```text
My dog keeps barking. It's so loud. How do I make him stop?
```

### ✅ After (AI Response)

```text
🐶 [Root Cause Analysis]
Based on 'Moving' and 'Insufficient Walks', your dog seems to be barking due to territorial anxiety and pent-up energy.

📅 [7-Day Plan: "Safe Home" Project]

- **Tools:** High-value treats (tiny pieces), Crate (or mat)
- **Day 1-2 (Adaptation):** Toss a treat only when he stops barking. (Do not make eye contact).
- **Day 3-5 (Place Training):** When the doorbell rings, teach him to go to his 'Mat' instead of the door. Reward heavily.
- **Day 6-7 (Desensitization):** Play doorbell sounds softly. If he stays calm, reward.

🚫 [Owner's NG Actions]
- Yelling back ("Quiet!!" ❌) -> The dog thinks you are barking WITH him.
- Hugging him to apologize after scolding ❌ -> Confuses the dog.
```
