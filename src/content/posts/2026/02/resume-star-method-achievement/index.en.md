> **Role (Role):** You are a senior executive headhunter with 15 years of experience and an expert in resume consulting.
>
> **Context (Context):**
>
> - Background: I have written out my project experience for my resume, but it reads too much like a generic job description. My actual achievements and impact are not standing out.
> - Goal: I want to rewrite this experience to strictly follow the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework and highlight my business value.
>
> **Task (Task):**
>
> 1. Analyze my input experience and restructure it into a clear **STAR format**.

> 3. Provide 3 **High-Impact, One-Sentence Bullet Points** that I can immediately copy and paste into my resume.
>

>
> **Constraints (Constraints):**
>
> - Strictly eliminate passive or vague phrasing such as 'worked hard on,' 'participated in,' or 'contributed to.'
> - Begin every final bullet point with a strong Action Verb (e.g., Spearheaded, Accelerated, Optimized).
> - Present the final output clearly divided into two sections: [STAR Analysis] and [Recommended Bullet Points].
>
> **Warning (Warning):**
>
> - Do not invent completely fake numbers. Instead, provide placeholders like `[X]%` and explain how I can safely calculate them based on my real data.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Why does this prompt work so well? The secret lies in forcing the AI to think like a seasoned recruiter rather than just a grammar checker. Most people struggle with the "Result" part of the STAR method because they don't know _what_ to measure. By instructing the AI to "suggest estimable indicators" when numbers are missing, this prompt acts as an interactive career coach. It bridges the gap between what you _did_ and the _business value_ you created. I've found this particularly effective for junior candidates who often underestimate their contributions—the AI will literally pull the metrics out of you!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: What if I honestly don't have any exact numbers or data from my previous job?**
  - A: That's completely normal! The Pro Version of this prompt is specifically designed for this scenario. The AI will suggest reasonable proxy metrics (e.g., "reduced manual processing time by [X] hours per week") that you can estimate safely without exaggerating or lying.

- **Q: Does this work for non-technical roles like HR or Customer Service?**
  - A: Absolutely. Every role has a quantifiable impact. For HR, it might be "time-to-hire" or "employee retention rate." For Customer Service, it could be "CSAT scores" or "ticket resolution time." The AI will tailor the metrics to your specific field.

- **Q: Can I use this for cover letters as well?**
  - A: Yes! You can easily tweak the Prompt's "Task" section to ask for a "short, persuasive paragraph suitable for a cover letter" instead of bullet points.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the persona of a "senior executive headhunter," the AI adopts a critical, results-oriented tone rather than a purely descriptive one.
2. **Action Verb Constraint:** Forcing the use of strong verbs (e.g., Spearheaded, Optimized) instantly elevates the professional tone and energy of the writing.
3. **Metric Extraction:** Specifically demanding numbers (or suggestions for them) prevents the AI from generating fluffy, generic marketing speak.
