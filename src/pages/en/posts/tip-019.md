_"Do you have to stamp a contract, but are scared of the tiny print and words like 'Party A', 'Party B', and 'Damages'?"_

The law does not protect those who sleep on their rights, but it is too harsh for those who do not know the law. Do not give up your rights because of difficult legal terms and complex sentences. An AI lawyer will kindly interpret for you by your side.

> ⚠️ **Caution:** AI's answers are for reference only and have no legal effect. For important contracts, strictly consult with an expert (Lawyer, Judicial Scrivener).
