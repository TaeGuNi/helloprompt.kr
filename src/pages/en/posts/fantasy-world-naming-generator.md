# 📝 Naming Unique Region/City in Fantasy World

**🎯 Recommended For:** Everyone

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility  |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
|  ⭐⭐☆☆☆   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ |

_"What was the name of the western forest? Should I just call it 'Western Forest'..."_

Immersion in a fantasy world is determined by **Naming**. 'Mordor' is much more attractive than 'Death Mountain', and 'Hogwarts' than 'Magic School'. Introducing a method to name plausible proper nouns without linguistic knowledge.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Input characteristics of the region (Terrain, Culture, Race).
2. AI creates plausible names by mixing specific language (Latin, Nordic, etc.) etymologies.
3. Provides origin and meaning of the name together to enrich the universe.
