# 📊 Taking a photo of your food is enough? AI Macro Nutrient Calculator

> **🎯 Target Audience:** Everyone

> **🤖 Recommended Model:** All AI models

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility  |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
|  ⭐⭐☆☆☆   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ |

_"100g chicken breast, 150g sweet potato... Are you tired of weighing every time and searching on apps to input?"_

The core of building a precise body is matching the macro (carbohydrate, protein, fat) ratio. However, the recording process is so cumbersome that it is easy to give up halfway. Now, tell AI like a conversation or show a picture of the food. It analyzes nutritional components in 1 second.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. It estimates nutritional components with just natural language text or food photos.
2. It tells you how much you are lacking/exceeding compared to your daily intake goal.
3. You can even get dinner menu recommendations tailored to the remaining calories.
