_"I worked really hard on this project, but why does it look so poor when written?"_

Value of project lies in **'what problem was solved'**. Simply listing functions is just a manual. Change your project into an attractive **'Problem Solving Story'**.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Clearly define project background (Problem) and solution process (Solution).
2. Separate and describe my specific contribution (Role) and achievement (Impact).
3. Emphasize 'Technical/Planning Challenge' that reader (interviewer) would be interested in.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Function Listing)

```text
Shopping Mall Website Production Project
- Function: Sign up, Product list, Cart, Payment
- Tech: React, Node.js, MongoDB
- Made it hard.
```

### ✅ After (Problem Solving Centered)

```markdown
### 🛍️ Building Commerce Platform Capable of Handling Massive Traffic

**Background:** Started to solve server down problem during traffic surge like Black Friday.

**Key Challenges:** Page loading delayed over 3 seconds due to DB bottleneck in situation of 10,000 concurrent users.

**My Solution:**

- **Redis Caching Adoption:** Distributed DB load by applying in-memory caching to frequently viewed product data.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Separated heavy logic like sending notification after payment asynchronously using Kafka.

**Results:** **Reduced** average response time from 3.2s to **0.5s by 84%**, and decreased user churn rate by 10%.
```

## 🎯 Conclusion
