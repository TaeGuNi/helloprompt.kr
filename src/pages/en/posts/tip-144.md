_"What exactly does it mean that the server is down?"_
_"API integration? What is that and why does it take 2 weeks?"_

Development terms seem like alien language. Even looking at the dictionary definition, I don't understand. In this case, 'Analogy' is the medicine. If you substitute it into a familiar situation, even complex technology can be understood at once. This prompt interprets stiff IT terms into soft everyday language.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Compare difficult IT terms to user-specified situations (restaurant, library, soccer team, etc.)
2. 1:1 Matching (Mapping) of elements in analogy and actual technical elements
3. Point out limitations (precautions) of the analogy to prevent misconceptions

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Dictionary Definition)

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: An interface made to control functions provided by an operating system or programming language so that they can be used in application programs... (Sleepy)

### ✅ After (Prompt Result: Restaurant Analogy)

**[Situation Analogy]**
API is a **'Restaurant Waiter (Server)'**.
Customers (You) don't go directly to the chef (Server) and shout "Give me pasta", right?
Instead, you order looking at the menu (Document) through the waiter.
Then the waiter takes the order sheet to the kitchen, receives the dish, and brings it to you.
You don't need to know whether there is a fire show or chopping in the kitchen. You just need to call the waiter.

**[1:1 Matching]**
| Restaurant Situation | IT Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Customer** | Client (User/App) |
| **Waiter** | **API** (Intermediary) |
| **Chef** | Server (Database) |
| **Menu** | API Document (Manual) |
| **Dish** | Data (Response) |

**[One Sentence Summary]**
"A smart clerk who runs errands between two programs that don't speak the same language."

## 🎯 Conclusion

If you don't understand, you can't use it. Analogy is a shortcut to understanding. Now don't be scared and talk to developers. "Ah, that waiter took the wrong order?"

Now leave work on time and go to a restaurant... no, call an API! 🍷
