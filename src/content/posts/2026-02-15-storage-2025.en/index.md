2025 was a pivotal year for data storage. With the explosion of multimodal AI models and video generation tools, the demand for raw capacity has skyrocketed. But how did the hardware hold up?

We analyzed the Backblaze Drive Stats for 2025 to understand the reliability landscape for AI-scale infrastructure.

## Key Findings for 2025

The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) across all drives settled at **1.45%**, a slight improvement over 2024. This stability is impressive given the increased workload intensity driven by AI training pipelines, which often involve massive sequential reads.

### The Rise of High-Density Drives

The star of the show in 2025 was the rapid adoption of 24TB and 26TB drives.

- **Seagate Exos X24**: Showed a remarkably low failure rate of 0.8% in its first full year of deployment.
- **Western Digital Gold 22TB**: Continued to be a workhorse for cold storage tiers.

### Storage for AI: It's Not Just Capacity

AI workloads differ from traditional cloud storage. The constant shuffling of training data puts unique thermal and vibrational stresses on the chassis. Backblaze's data suggests that drives in newer, better-ventilated pods performed 15% better than those in legacy enclosures, highlighting the importance of thermal management for AI clusters.

## Conclusion

As we move into 2026, the reliability of spinning rust remains critical. While SSDs handle the inference and hot caching, HDDs are still the bedrock of the AI training lake. The 2025 stats confirm that manufacturers are successfully scaling density without sacrificing reliability.
