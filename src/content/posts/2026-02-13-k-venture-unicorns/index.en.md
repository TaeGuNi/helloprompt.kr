## New Horizons for K-Ventures in 2025: The Surge of AI

Last year, the South Korean venture ecosystem achieved brilliant results despite the economic winter. According to the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, 3 out of 4 domestic startups that newly ascended to unicorn status (unlisted companies with a valuation of over 1 trillion KRW) in 2025 were Artificial Intelligence (AI) based companies.

### Transition to the AI-First Era

This is not a mere coincidence. Amidst the shift in the global technological paradigm led by Generative AI, Korean AI startups have begun to be recognized for their practical revenue models and technological capabilities.

These newly minted unicorn companies share the following commonalities:
*   **Proprietary Core Technology**: Possession of independent Large Language Models (LLM) or specialized Small Language Models (sLLM) that do not rely on global big tech.
*   **Success in B2B Monetization**: Establishing a solid foothold in the enterprise solution market.
*   **Global Scalability**: Targeting the global market beyond the domestic market from the early stages of founding.

### The Future of K-Unicorns

Experts predict that this trend will continue for the time being. With the government's large-scale AI investment support combined with the influx of private capital, the birth of 'K-AI Unicorns' will accelerate further. The Korean venture ecosystem has now completed its constitutional improvement from 'Platform-centric' to 'Deep Tech', and specifically 'AI-centric'.

Expectations are high for the performance of new unicorns on the global stage.
