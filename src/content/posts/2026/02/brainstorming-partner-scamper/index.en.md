<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need high-quality, structured, and unconventional brainstorming.

Copy the **PROMPT** below and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

> **Role (Role):** You are an elite Creativity Consultant and a master of lateral thinking.
>
> **Context (Context):**
>
> - Background: I am conceptualizing new ideas regarding `[Topic/Project Name]`.
> - Current State: So far, I have only thought of `[Your Existing Ideas]`.
> - Goal: Break out of conventional thinking and discover entirely new angles.
>
> **Task (Task):**
>
> 1. Apply the SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to generate 7 distinct, innovative ideas based on my topic.
> 2. Propose 3 wildly unconventional ideas by benchmarking successful strategies from completely unrelated industries.
> 3. Disregard immediate technical feasibility or budget constraints; focus purely on radical innovation and paradigm-shifting concepts.
>
> **Constraints (Constraints):**
>
> - Do not try to provide a single "correct" answer. Your goal is to maximize the breadth of possibilities.
> - Present the output as a Markdown table or a highly structured list, using short, punchy keywords and a 1-sentence explanation for each.
>
> **Warning (Warning):**
>
> - Avoid cliché or generic suggestions. If an idea is too obvious, discard it and generate a bolder one.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a lifesaver during the early stages of product ideation or when trying to find a unique marketing angle. The true power here isn't just asking for "new ideas," but forcing the AI to use a structured framework like SCAMPER combined with forced lateral thinking (borrowing from unrelated industries).

When you run this, you'll likely find that 70% of the ideas are too wild to use directly. **That is exactly the point.** Those wild ideas act as stepping stones. You take an impossible AI suggestion and dial it back just enough to make it a brilliant, viable human idea. Try feeding the AI a very boring, traditional industry (like "accounting software") and watch it apply strategies from "theme parks" or "fast food."

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: The ideas generated are too unrealistic. How do I fix this?**
  - A: The Pro prompt intentionally ignores feasibility to encourage out-of-the-box thinking. If you need practical ideas, add a constraint like: "Ensure all ideas can be implemented within a $5,000 budget and a 2-week timeframe."

- **Q: Which AI model works best for brainstorming?**
  - A: Claude 3.5 Sonnet tends to excel at nuanced, creative writing and lateral thinking, while GPT-4o is excellent at strictly adhering to the SCAMPER framework. Try both and see which output sparks your imagination more.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Framework Integration:** By explicitly mentioning the SCAMPER technique, we force the LLM out of its default, highly probable (and therefore boring) generation patterns into a structured creative exercise.
2. **Permission to be Impractical:** The instruction to "disregard feasibility" is crucial. LLMs are naturally aligned to be helpful and practical, which often stifles radical creativity. This constraint acts as an "override" switch.
3. **Cross-Industry Benchmarking:** This prompts the AI to map semantic relationships between distant concepts, which is the core definition of human creativity (connecting the unconnected).

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
Give me some new tumbler design ideas.
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
**SCAMPER Framework Ideation:**
1. (Substitute) Replace stainless steel with a self-healing polymer that repairs scratches.
2. (Combine) Tumbler + Modular Magnetic Base (attach supplements, keys, or a wireless charger).
3. (Adapt) Mimic the thermal regulation of a toucan's beak for passive cooling.
4. (Modify) Exaggerate the grip—create a fully ergonomic, custom-molded silicone sleeve.
5. (Put to another use) The lid doubles as a portable espresso tamper.
6. (Eliminate) Remove the lid entirely; use a magnetic spill-proof tension barrier.
7. (Reverse) Instead of keeping drinks hot, the tumbler actively heats the liquid via a kinetic-charging base.

**Lateral Industry Benchmarking:**
- (Gaming Industry): Introduce "achievement unlocked" color-shifting exteriors based on hydration milestones.
- (Automotive): Use shock-absorbing suspension tech in the base to prevent spills when dropped.
