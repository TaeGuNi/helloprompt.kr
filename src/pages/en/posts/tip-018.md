_"Did you sign up for the gym with big ambitions but only end up walking on the treadmill? You can set up a systematic exercise plan without expensive PT."_

In exercise, 'how' you combine things is more important than 'what' you do. If you just follow random YouTube videos, your body balance might break. Tell AI your body condition and get a scientific split workout routine prescribed.

1. Manage systematic exercise and diet with an AI trainer without expensive PT.
2. Receive prescriptions for scientific split routines and customized diets tailored to your physical condition and goals.
