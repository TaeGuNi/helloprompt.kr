The **Matrix.org** homeserver has reported a massive spike in new signups following Discord's announcement that it will require age verification for all users starting next month. The decentralized communication protocol is positioning itself as an open alternative for communities seeking refuge from centralized platform policies.

### The Decentralized Difference

Unlike Discord, Matrix is an open standard similar to email or the web. Users can choose from various clients and, crucially, run their own servers on their own terms. This decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the entire network or the data within it.

### Regulatory Reality Check

However, the Matrix team cautioned that decentralization does not grant immunity from the law. "Server admins are still subject to the law in the jurisdiction where they operate," the blog post stated. This is particularly relevant as the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) and similar legislation in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU mandate strict age verification.

For the flagship **matrix.org** homeserver—which restricts use to those 18 and older—the team is evaluating privacy-preserving verification methods. One proposed solution is using credit card payments for Premium accounts as a verification signal.

### Feature Gaps and Future Roadmap

While welcoming new users, Matrix acknowledged that the ecosystem is not yet a feature-complete "drop-in replacement" for Discord. Key features like seamless voice channels, game streaming, and rich moderation tools are still catching up, primarily because development has focused on secure public sector deployments.

To address server load and give users more freedom, Matrix is accelerating work on **Account Portability**, which will allow users to migrate their identity and history between servers easily.

"At least in Matrix you have the opportunity to run your own servers as you wish," the team concluded, encouraging users to take control of their digital infrastructure while being mindful of legal compliance.
