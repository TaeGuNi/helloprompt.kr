Two masters from art history, who could never have met in reality, have encountered each other through AI technology. What kind of artwork would be born if the styles of **Shin Yun-bok**, a master of late Joseon genre painting, and **Claude Monet**, the father of Impressionism, were fused together?

## The Meeting of Eastern Lines and Western Light

Shin Yun-bok's masterpiece **‘Portrait of a Beauty’** is characterized by the elegant posture of the woman, delicate expression of clothing folds, and subtle colors. In contrast, Monet is famous for capturing the momentary impression of colors changing with the light on canvas.

AI has harmoniously fused these two contrasting styles in a surprising way.

1.  **Change in Brushstrokes**: Instead of Shin Yun-bok's characteristic sharp and detailed ink lines, Monet-style short and thick brushstrokes wrap around the skirt of the hanbok.
2.  **Reinterpretation of Color**: The original's calm indigo skirt has transformed into an Impressionist palette that seems to sparkle with light.
3.  **Dreamlike Background**: Unlike the original where the beauty of empty space was emphasized, the background is treated dreamily, like a Monet garden landscape with rising haze.

## An Artistic Experiment Transcending Time and Space

Such attempts go beyond simple stylistic imitation, showcasing the potential of AI art to visualize the imagination of **‘What if’**. When the restrained beauty of Joseon absorbs the light of French Impressionism, we discover completely new emotions within familiar masterpieces.

AI Art Lab will continue to attempt various artistic fusions transcending time and space, exploring the new beauty created by technology and art.
