## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly effective because it shifts AI from a passive assistant to an active antagonist. Most candidates fail interviews not because they lack skills, but because they crumble under the pressure of unexpected follow-up questions. By instructing the AI to specifically look for "loopholes" and ask probing questions (like demanding specific metrics or clarifying exact roles), you are stress-testing your own narratives.

_Pro Tip:_ For the absolute best results, use ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode on your smartphone. Put your phone on the desk, put on professional attire, and treat the AI's voice as a real human. The spontaneous nature of speaking out loud will expose your filler words ("um," "like") and hesitant pacing much faster than typing ever could.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well on the free tier of ChatGPT or Claude?**
  - A: Yes, the text-based mock interview works perfectly fine on free models. However, to get the closest experience to a real interview, subscribing to ChatGPT Plus to access the low-latency Advanced Voice Mode is highly recommended.

- **Q: How do I make the AI ask questions specific to my resume?**
  - A: Before pasting the Pro Prompt, simply upload a PDF of your resume or paste its text and say: _"Read my resume. Then, apply the following prompt to conduct a mock interview based on this experience."_

- **Q: The AI is being too nice. How can I make it scarier?**
  - A: Modify the Role section. Add constraints like: _"Never compliment the candidate. Always adopt a skeptical tone. Interrupt me if my answer takes longer than 2 minutes."_

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Strict Persona Assignment:** By defining the AI as a "10-year veteran at [Company]" who is "highly analytical and skeptical," we prevent the AI from defaulting to its usual overly polite, helpful tone.
2. **One-Question Constraint:** The rule to "Ask only one question at a time" is crucial. AI naturally tends to list 5-10 questions at once, which ruins the real-time dynamic of an interview.
3. **Follow-up Focus:** Instructing the AI to specifically hunt for missing metrics or vague contributions ensures the practice session actually challenges your answers.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Practicing Alone

```text
Me: "I consider myself a very diligent problem solver."
(Inner thought: Ah, that sounds a bit cliché. Let me try phrasing it differently...)
-> Result: No actual pressure, no follow-up questions, and zero objective feedback on the delivery.
```

### ✅ Practicing with the AI Interviewer

```text
Me: "I have excellent problem-solving skills and led my team to success."
AI Interviewer: "Claiming excellent problem-solving skills is easy. Can you provide a specific, recent example of a complex technical issue you resolved? Furthermore, what was your exact, individual contribution to that resolution versus what the rest of the team handled?"
Me: (Flustered but forced to articulate) "Well, in my last project regarding the database migration..."
-> Result: Practical adaptability increases dramatically! 📈
```
