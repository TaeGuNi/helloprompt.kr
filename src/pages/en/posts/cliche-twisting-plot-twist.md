## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Hero killed demon king and saved the world."

### ✅ After (Twist Proposal)

**Idea 1: Cycle of Loop**

- **Twist:** As soon as demon king is killed, demon king's soul dwells in hero's body. Actually demon king was 'previous hero', and this world was a system maintained only if hero becomes demon king.
- **Foreshadowing:** Scene where demon king looked at hero with sad eyes without attacking whenever seeing hero. Reason why village elders sympathized with hero instead of cheering.
