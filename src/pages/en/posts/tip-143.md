_"I said I'd fix it later, and it's been a year. Now I'm scared to touch it."_

Spaghetti code (tangled code) is a developer's enemy. Poor readability makes bugs hard to find and features hard to add. This prompt channels Robert C. Martin (author of Clean Code) to wash and polish your code until it sparkles.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Remove duplicate code and separate functions (Extract Method).
2. Improve unclear variable/function names (Naming Convention).
3. Optimize performance and apply modern syntax (Modern Syntax).

## 🚀 Solution: "Clean Code Laundry"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a `[Clean Code Evangelist and Chief Architect]`.
> **Request:** Provide a prompt that upgrades working but messy code into clean, readable, and maintainable code.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** below and use it.

> **Role:** You are a `[Clean Code Evangelist and Chief Architect]`.
>
> **Context:** My code works, but it's messy and hard to read (Dirty Code). Refactor it to be easy to maintain.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. **[Naming Sense]**: Change variable and function names to be intuitive and meaningful. (e.g., `a` -> `userAge`)
> 2. **[Structure Improvement]**: Break down functions that are too long by role, and merge duplicate logic into one.
> 3. **[Modernize]**: If possible, apply the latest language syntax (ES6+, Python 3.10+, etc.).
> 4. **[Before & After]**: Compare what changed and how, and explain the reason for the change.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - The operation (function) of the code must never change.
> - Add comments only where absolutely necessary. (Delete comments if the code explains itself)
>
> **Target Code:**
>
> ```python
> [Paste your dirty(?) code here]
> ```

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```python
def calc(x, y):
    if x > 19:
        print("Adult")
        p = y * 0.9
        return p
    else:
        print("Student")
        return y
```

(Function name `calc` doesn't say what it calculates, and `p` is meaningless)

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

```python
def calculate_discounted_price(age, price):
    ADULT_AGE_THRESHOLD = 20
    DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.9

    if age >= ADULT_AGE_THRESHOLD:
        print("You are an adult.")
        return price * DISCOUNT_RATE

    print("You are a student.")
    return price
```

**[Improvement Points]**

1. **Function Name Change**: `calc` -> `calculate_discounted_price` (Clarifies it calculates discounted price)
2. **Magic Number Removal**: Declared numbers like `19`, `0.9` as constants to give them meaning.
3. **Unnecessary else Removal**: Used Early Return pattern to reduce indentation depth.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Well-written code reads smoothly like a well-written essay. Clean your code for your future self (and colleagues).

Now leave work on time and take a shower. Wash your body, not just the code. 🍷
