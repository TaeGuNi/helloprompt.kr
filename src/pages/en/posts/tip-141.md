## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input - Python)

```python
result = [x * 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

**[Summary]**
This code selects only even numbers from 0 to 9, doubles their values, and stores them in a new list.

**[Line-by-Line Analysis]**

```python
# Take numbers one by one from 0 to 9 (range(10)) and assign to variable x.
# If (if) the remainder of x divided by 2 is 0 (even),
# Multiply x by 2 and put it in the list.
result = [x * 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

**[Syntax Point: List Comprehension]**
A unique syntax in Python used to concisely create a list in one line using a `for` loop and an `if` condition.

- Structure: `[Expression for Item in Iterable if Condition]`

## 🎯 Conclusion

Code is a language for talking to machines, but ultimately it must be read and modified by humans. Code you don't understand is like a time bomb. Remove the detonator.

Now, leave work on time... you're not going home to code, are you? 🍷
