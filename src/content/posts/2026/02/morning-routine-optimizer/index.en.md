## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a game-changer because it incorporates the "Minimum Viable Routine" (MVR). The biggest reason morning routines fail is the "all-or-nothing" mindset. If you oversleep by 20 minutes, you usually abandon the whole routine. By asking the AI to provide a fallback 5-minute version, you maintain the _habit_ of doing a routine, even on your worst days. I personally use my MVR (drink water, 2 minutes of stretching, write 1 priority) at least twice a week, and it keeps my momentum alive.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: What if my schedule changes every day?**
  - A: You can modify the `[Context]` section to ask the AI for a "modular" routine. Ask it to categorize tasks into "Must-do," "Should-do," and "Could-do" so you can mix and match based on the time you have each morning.

- **Q: Does this work better with Claude or ChatGPT?**
  - A: Both work brilliantly, but Claude 3.5 Sonnet tends to write more empathetic, human-sounding habit advice, while GPT-4o is excellent at strict time-boxing and formatting.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Circadian Context:** By providing your wake-up time and current feelings, the AI adjusts the intensity of the tasks.
2. **The "MVR" Concept:** Anticipating failure is the best way to ensure long-term success. The fallback routine prevents habit breakage.
3. **Scientific Justification:** Asking the AI to explain the _why_ behind each task increases your intrinsic motivation to actually do it.
