Anthropic has announced a staggering ** billion Series G funding round**, valuing the company at ** billion post-money**. The round was led by GIC and Coatue, with participation from major players including Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Founders Fund. This capital injection is set to fuel Anthropic's continued dominance in the enterprise AI sector.

### Explosive Financial Growth

The funding comes on the back of remarkable financial performance. Anthropic's Chief Financial Officer, Krishna Rao, highlighted that the company's run-rate revenue has hit ** billion**, growing over 10x annually for the past three consecutive years. 

"Whether it is entrepreneurs, startups, or the world’s largest enterprises, the message from our customers is the same: Claude is increasingly becoming critical to how businesses work," Rao stated.

### The Rise of Claude Code

A significant driver of this growth is **Claude Code**, Anthropic's agentic coding platform. Since its public release in May 2025, it has reshaped software development:
- **Run-rate revenue:** Surpassed .5 billion, doubling since the start of 2026.
- **Global Impact:** An estimated **4% of all public GitHub commits** worldwide are now authored by Claude Code.
- **Enterprise Adoption:** Business subscriptions have quadrupled this year, with enterprise use now accounting for over half of all Claude Code revenue.

### Frontier Models and Infrastructure

Anthropic continues to push the technical envelope with its newest model, **Opus 4.6**, which launched last week. It currently leads the industry on GDPval-AA, a benchmark for economically valuable knowledge work.

Uniquely, Claude remains the only frontier AI model available across all three major cloud platforms—AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure—and is trained on a diverse hardware stack including AWS Trainium, Google TPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. This infrastructure diversity provides resilience and performance optimization that has become a key selling point for their enterprise customer base, which now includes eight of the Fortune 10 companies.
