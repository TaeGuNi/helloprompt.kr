# 📝 Just Throw JSON and TypeScript Type Definitions Appear! (feat. Zod)

_"Backend API responses are so complex, when will I make all these into interfaces?"_

Are you typing `interface User { ... }` manually?
Nested objects, arrays, optional values... perfect for making mistakes.
Just copy and paste the API response JSON. We'll create perfect TypeScript type definitions, as well as Zod schemas for runtime validation.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Convert JSON data into TypeScript Interface/Type
2. Generate Zod/Yup schemas for runtime validation
3. Perfectly handle nested structures (Nested Objects)

## 🚀 Solution: "Type Master"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a senior developer well-versed in the TypeScript ecosystem.
> **Request:** Provide a prompt that automatically converts complex JSON data into TypeScript interfaces or Zod schemas.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a senior developer well-versed in the TypeScript ecosystem.
>
> **Context:** I received JSON data from an external API, and I need type definitions to use it safely in my project.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Write a **TypeScript Interface** based on the JSON data below. (Name it in PascalCase)
> 2. Also write a **Zod Schema** for runtime validation.
> 3. Include code to infer types (`z.infer`) from the Zod schema.
>
> **JSON Data:**
>
> ```text
> [Paste JSON data here]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Assume all fields are required by default, but handle them as optional (`?`) only if `null` is included.
> - Define objects inside arrays as separate interfaces as well.
> - Add JSDoc comments to explain (by inference) what each field is.

## 🧬 Why it works?

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input JSON)

```text
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Jay",
  "contact": {
    "email": "jay@test.com",
    "phone": null
  },
  "tags": ["developer", "admin"]
}
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// 1. Zod Schema Definition
export const ContactSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  phone: z.string().nullable().optional(), // null handling
});

export const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string(),
  contact: ContactSchema,
  tags: z.array(z.string()),
});

// 2. TypeScript Type Inference
/** User information interface */
export type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;
export type Contact = z.infer<typeof ContactSchema>;
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Type definitions are safety devices, but the process of creating them shouldn't be painful.
Build a safe and robust type system with a single copy and paste! 🍷
