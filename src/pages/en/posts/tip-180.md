## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Keywords only)

Sofa, rain, phone... (Not connected)

### ✅ After (Lyric Writing Result)

**[Verse 1]**
On this **old sofa** we chose together
I feel like I'm the one who's become worn out, left alone
The **sound of rain** seeping through the window crack
Sounds just like your nagging, so I cover my ears

**[Chorus]**
In the list of **missed calls** that don't ring
Words left unsaid are still piling up
Those three syllables of your name that won't be erased
Why do they feel so heavy today?
