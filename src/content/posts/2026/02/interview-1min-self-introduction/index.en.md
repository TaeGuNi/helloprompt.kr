## 💡 작성자 코멘트 (Insight)

Why does this prompt work so well? Most candidates make the fatal mistake of using the 1-minute introduction to recite their resume chronologically. Interviewers already have your resume; they don't need an audio version of it.

This prompt forces the AI to structure your pitch deductively—giving away the "punchline" (your core value) first, and then backing it up with two solid pillars of evidence. By explicitly banning clichés and dictating the exact speaking time (45-50 seconds), the AI generates a script that sounds natural, punches hard, and respects the interviewer's time.

_Pro Tip: Once the AI gives you the script, read it out loud several times and replace any overly complex words with your natural speaking vocabulary so it doesn't sound robotic._

## 🙋 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well for fresh graduates with no work experience?**
  - A: Absolutely. Instead of professional experience, input your academic projects, leadership roles in clubs, or specific coursework into the `[Strength]` variables. The AI will perfectly adapt the tone to highlight your potential and learnability.

- **Q: The generated script feels a bit too formal for my industry (e.g., a startup). How can I fix this?**
  - A: You can simply add a line to the **Constraints** section: _"Adopt a conversational, energetic, and slightly informal tone suitable for a dynamic tech startup environment."_ The AI will adjust the vocabulary accordingly.

- **Q: Can I use this for a 3-minute introduction?**
  - A: Yes, but you shouldn't just ask the AI to "make it 3 minutes." For longer intros, you need more substance. Add a `[Strength 3]` and include a new instruction in the **Task** section: _"Elaborate on one specific project where I applied these strengths to overcome a major challenge."_

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By combining "executive coach" and "ad copywriter," the AI understands it needs to sell you as a premium brand, not just generate a generic list of skills.
2. **Strict Constraints:** Explicitly banning clichés (like "I'm a sponge") prevents the AI from falling into the trap of terrible, outdated interview advice.
3. **Time Formatting:** Asking for a specific speaking duration (45-50 seconds) ensures the output isn't a massive wall of text that you have to brutally edit down later.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (The Cliche)

```text
"Hello! I am a sponge-like applicant, John Doe.
Just like a sponge absorbs water, I am ready to learn anything you teach me.
Ever since I was young, I was taught to listen carefully and work hard..."
```

_(Result: Too long, boring, and highly forgettable. The interviewer has already stopped listening.)_

### ✅ After (The Impact)

```text
"A marketer who translates raw data into customer desires—that is who I am.
I bring two core strengths to this role.
First, my ability to connect analytical insights directly to sales, honed through three years of optimizing e-commerce funnels.
Second, my fluency in global business etiquette, developed by managing direct communications with our North American enterprise clients.
I plan to leverage these competencies to drive a 10% increase in your international market retention rate within my first year.
Thank you."
```
