Budgeting doesn't have to mean tracking every single coffee purchase. The **50/30/20 Rule** offers a highly effective, low-stress alternative.

This prompt acts as your personal financial coach, automatically calculating these buckets and tailoring them to your unique living situation.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly powerful because it removes the friction from budgeting. Most people quit budgeting because they suffer from decision fatigue when categorizing minor transactions. By using AI to establish your macro-level 50/30/20 buckets, you only need to ensure your total spending per bucket stays within the limit.

I highly recommend running this prompt whenever your income changes (e.g., getting a raise or changing jobs). Furthermore, the AI's ability to intelligently adjust the ratio (like suggesting a 60/20/20 split for those living in high-cost areas) makes this far superior to a simple static calculator. It gives you permission to be flexible while still hitting your savings goals.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work with any currency?**
  - A: Absolutely. Whether you input USD, EUR, KRW, or any other currency, the AI perfectly calculates the percentages. Just make sure to input your _net_ (after-tax) income.

- **Q: What if I have a lot of high-interest debt?**
  - A: You can instruct the AI in the Pro Version's context: "I have $5,000 in credit card debt." The AI will typically advise allocating the entire 20% 'Savings' portion strictly toward aggressive debt repayment until it is cleared.

- **Q: Is the 50/30/20 rule realistic for low-income earners?**
  - A: It can be challenging. If your basic needs exceed 50%, you can ask the AI to generate a modified ratio, such as 60/20/20 or even 70/20/10, prioritizing immediate survival while still building the long-term habit of saving.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the persona of a "Minimalist Asset Management Coach," the AI adopts an encouraging, practical, and non-judgmental tone.
2. **Contextual Awareness:** Providing details allows the AI to avoid giving generic, out-of-touch advice and forces it to address the realities of your fixed costs.
3. **Structured Output (Constraints):** Forcing a Markdown table makes the financial data instantly readable, making it incredibly easy to copy and paste into Notion or a spreadsheet.

### ❌ Before (Input)

Calculate the 50 30 20 rule for my $2,500 salary.
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
### ⚖️ Your 50/30/20 Budget Breakdown ($2,500/month)

| Category | Ratio | Amount | Included Items (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Needs** | 50% | **$1,250** | Rent, Utilities, Groceries, Transportation, Insurance |
| **Wants** | 30% | **$750** | Dining Out, Shopping, Streaming Services, Hobbies |
| **Savings** | 20% | **$500** | Emergency Fund, 401(k)/IRA, Debt Repayment |

**💡 Coach's Advice:**
Living alone in a high-rent city often pushes "Needs" above 50%. If your rent and essentials total $1,500 (60%), don't panic. You can adjust your ratio to **60/20/20**. This means reducing your "Wants" budget to $500 to accommodate your living situation, while fiercely protecting that $500 Savings/Debt bucket!
