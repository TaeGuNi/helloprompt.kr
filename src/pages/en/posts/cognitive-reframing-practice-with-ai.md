_"Are you putting yourself down saying 'I'm no good' just because you made one mistake?"_

This pattern of thinking is called 'Cognitive Distortion'. If it becomes a habit, it can lead to depression. Cognitive Reframing is a training to take off these distorted glasses and see the facts as they are, or in a more helpful direction. AI becomes your objective mirror.
