_"I want to show the structure of this complex city at a glance."_

**High Angle** (or **Bird's Eye View**, **Drone Shot**) looking down from a high place is optimal for grasping the overall context and layout. Used to make the subject look small and weak, or to contain vast land.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. `Drone view`, `Aerial photography` are the most certain keywords.
2. `Top-down view` is a 90-degree angle looking down vertically.
3. `Bird's eye view` is a diagonal bird's-eye view as if a bird is flying and watching.
