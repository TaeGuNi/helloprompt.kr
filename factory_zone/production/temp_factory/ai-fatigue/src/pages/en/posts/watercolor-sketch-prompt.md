_"I want a sketch feeling slightly smudged with paint, drawn in an architect's diary."_

**Watercolor Sketch** is a style combining the detail of pencil lines and the accidental spreading effect of paint. It is best for expressing clear, clean, and analog sensibility.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Combine `Watercolor painting`, `Pencil sketch`.
2. Give water spreading effect with `Wet-on-wet`, `Splatter` keywords.
3. Must use `White background` for clear colors to stand out.
