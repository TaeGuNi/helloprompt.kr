Waymo has officially begun fully autonomous operations using its 6th-generation driver system. This update marks a significant advancement in both hardware and software, aiming to provide a safer and more comfortable experience for passengers.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Sensor System

The new 6th-generation driver boasts a more precise and powerful suite of sensors compared to previous generations. It offers a wider field of view and higher resolution, allowing for more accurate detection of surrounding objects and pedestrians, even in complex urban environments.

### 2. Improved Weather Handling

Performance in adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, and snow has been significantly improved. With sensor cleaning systems and enhanced perception algorithms, the vehicle can provide consistent service regardless of weather conditions.

### 3. Smoother Ride Capability

Sudden stops have been reduced, and acceleration and deceleration feel more natural. Optimizing driving logic based on millions of miles of driving data, Waymo has achieved a ride quality that feels as smooth as if a skilled human driver were behind the wheel.

The introduction of Waymo's 6th-generation system is seen as a major milestone accelerating the commercialization of autonomous driving technology.
