# 📝 My Code Can Be Hacked? Vulnerability Check by AI Sheriff

> **🎯 Recommended for:** Everyone
> **⏱️ Time required:** 5 minutes

_"Surely no one would hack my toy project?"_

Yes, they do. Automated bots tirelessly scrape the internet looking for vulnerable servers.
The DB can be stolen with a single SQL injection, and user cookies can be hijacked by XSS attacks.
Show your code to the AI Sheriff before deployment and get a 'Secure Coding' prescription.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Identify potential security vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.) in code
2. Risk analysis based on OWASP Top 10
3. Suggest fixes with secure code

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a White Hat Hacker and Cyber Security Expert.
>
> **Context:** I want to check if there are any security risks in the code I wrote.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Analyze the code below and find all **Vulnerabilities**.
> 2. Explain what kind of attack (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) each vulnerability can be exposed to.
> 3. Write **Secure Code** that resolves the vulnerabilities.
>
> **Code to Analyze:**
>
> ```
> [Paste suspicious code here]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Prioritize review based on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
> - Don't just say "It's dangerous," but briefly mention "how it can be attacked" scenarios.

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Code - PHP)

```php
$username = $_POST['user'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" . $username . "'";
$db->query($query);
```

### ✅ After (Diagnosis and Fix)

**🚨 Found Vulnerability:** **SQL Injection**
If an attacker enters a value like `' OR '1'='1` in `$username`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1'`, revealing all user information.

**🛡️ Fixed Code (Using Prepared Statement):**

```php
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $_POST['user']);
$stmt->execute();
```

_Explanation: Used `prepare` and `bind_param` to treat input values as pure data, not part of the query, blocking injection at the source._

## 🎯 Conclusion

Security incidents cannot be fixed after they explode.
Don't be the protagonist of the proverb "Locking the barn door after the horse is stolen." You can prevent a catastrophe by fixing a single line of code. 🍷
