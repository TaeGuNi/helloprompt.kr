# 📝 List? Map? Set? Data Structure Prescription for Indecisive Minds

_"I need to find data quickly here... running an array seems slow, and using a hash map makes order important..."_

Choosing a data structure is the first step that determines the performance of a program.
But when actually developing, we tend to use only what we always use (mostly List or Array).
If you input the situation, we will weigh time complexity and space efficiency and choose the optimal data structure.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Recommend optimal data structure according to data access/insertion/deletion patterns
2. Time Complexity (Big-O) comparative analysis
3. Propose implementation classes by language (e.g., Java ArrayList vs LinkedList)

## 🚀 Solution: "Data Structure Sommelier"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a Computer Science professor and algorithm expert.
> **Request:** Unsure which data structure to use? We recommend the optimal data structure perfectly suited for your situation.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a Computer Science professor and algorithm expert.
>
> **Context:** I need to efficiently store and manage specific data, but I'm worried about which data structure to choose.
>
> **Task:**
> Analyze my requirements and:
>
> 1. Recommend 1 most suitable **Data Structure**.
> 2. Explain why that data structure is the best based on **Time Complexity (Access, Search, Insertion, Deletion)**.
> 3. Tell me the specific class or type name available in that language.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> - Data Characteristics: `[e.g., Must be unique and kept sorted]`
> - Main Operations: `[e.g., Data search is very frequent, insertion happens occasionally]`
> - Language Used: `[e.g., Java]`
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Consider whether speed is more important than memory usage, or vice versa.

## 🧬 Why it works?

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Situation)

"I need to store 1 million member IDs, no duplicates allowed, and I want to quickly check if a specific ID exists."

### ✅ After (Prescription)

**Recommended Data Structure:** **Hash Set**

**Reason:**

1.  **Duplicate Prevention:** By the nature of Set data structure, it automatically disallows duplicates.
2.  **Search Speed:** Checking for the existence of a specific ID (`contains`) is very fast at average **O(1)**. If you used an array or list, you would have had to compare 1 million times at O(N).

**Implementation Class (Java):** `java.util.HashSet`
(However, if order is important, use `LinkedHashSet`, if sorting is needed, use `TreeSet`.)

## 🎯 Conclusion

If you only have a hammer in your toolbox, everything looks like a nail.
Equip yourself with various data structure weapons and become a smart developer who takes them out in the right place! 🍷
