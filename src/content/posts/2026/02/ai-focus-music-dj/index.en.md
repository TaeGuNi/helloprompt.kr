## 🚀 The Solution: "AI Focus DJ"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need a quick playlist without overthinking it.

> **Role:** You are a focus and productivity music expert.
> **Task:** Recommend a YouTube or Spotify search query for background music that will help me focus on `[your specific task, e.g., coding, writing, studying]`. I need something without lyrics.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this for deep, extended flow states tailored to your exact neuro-rhythm.

> **Role:** You are an elite audio-psychologist and productivity DJ. You specialize in curating soundscapes that optimize brainwave states (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) for peak cognitive performance.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Current State: I am feeling `[your current energy level, e.g., sluggish, anxious, hyperactive]`.
> - Task: I need to do `[specific task, e.g., debug complex React code, write a strategic marketing plan]`.
> - Duration: I need to focus intensely for `[duration, e.g., 90 minutes]`.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Analyze the cognitive requirements of my task and my current energy level.
> 2. Recommend 3 specific music genres or soundscape styles (e.g., 40Hz Binaural Beats, Lo-Fi Chillhop, Cinematic Ambient) that will transition my brain into the optimal state for this task.
> 3. Provide exact, copy-pasteable search queries for YouTube and Spotify for each recommendation.
> 4. Suggest an optimal volume level (e.g., 30%, 50%) for the recommended audio.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Absolutely NO tracks with vocals or distracting sudden beat drops.
> - Output the recommendations using a Markdown list, not a table.
>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Do not recommend generic pop or highly stimulating EDM unless it explicitly fits the cognitive profile of the task. Keep it strictly focused on productivity enhancement.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Music isn't just background noise; it's a cognitive anchor. I used to spend 15 minutes every morning just trying to find the right playlist, only to get distracted by a podcast. By using this prompt, I bypass the algorithm's attempts to entertain me and immediately access audio engineered for output. The Pro version is incredibly effective because it accounts for your _current_ energy level. If I'm over-caffeinated and anxious, it recommends grounding, ambient frequencies. If I'm groggy, it suggests driving, up-tempo instrumental beats to wake up my brain.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Do I really need specific frequencies like 40Hz?**
  - A: While not strictly mandatory, research suggests 40Hz frequencies (Gamma waves) can significantly enhance focus and problem-solving. This prompt helps you easily find these specialized tracks.

- **Q: Does this work for creative tasks as well as analytical ones?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just be sure to specify "Creative Brainstorming" or "Design Work" in the task variable. The AI will adjust the recommendation from highly structured beats to more fluid, inspiring soundscapes.
