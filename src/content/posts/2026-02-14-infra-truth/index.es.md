The tech world is drowning in noise. We call it innovation; users call it exhaustion.

## The Problem

This post explores the critical issue of **infra-truth**. While executives cheer for metrics, the reality on the ground is different. We are seeing a massive disconnect between promise and delivery.

This isn't just a glitch. It's a systemic failure.

## The Reality
