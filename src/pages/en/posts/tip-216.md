_"Do you just wait after the interview is over?"_

Overseas (especially in the US), a **Thank You Email** after an interview is essential, but it is still unfamiliar in Korea. That's why it's more effective. A polite email sent when everyone else stays silent makes you remembered as a 'sensible and polite candidate'.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Express gratitude for the opportunity to interview.
2. Reaffirm your interest by mentioning impressive conversations during the interview.
3. (Optional) Briefly supplement parts where your answers were lacking or re-emphasize your strengths.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Not sent)

```text
(Waiting nervously believing no news is good news)
```

### ✅ After (Email sent)

```text
Subject: [Thank You] Marketing Position Applicant Kim Cheol-su

Hello, Director.
Thank you very much for taking your precious time to conduct the interview today.

I was especially impressed by your explanation of the 'data-driven decision-making culture'.
It was a time that gave me confidence in how my analytical skills could contribute to your company's growth.

I felt I couldn't sufficiently explain the use of statistical tools due to nervousness during the interview,
so I am attaching a link to a relevant portfolio for your reference.

I look forward to seeing you again with good results.
Thank you.

Sincerely,
Kim Cheol-su
```
