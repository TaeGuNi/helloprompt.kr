<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this for a highly realistic, tailored negotiation simulation.

> **Role:** You are a meticulous HR manager. Your primary goal is to defend the company's budget and negotiate the employee's salary raise as conservatively as possible.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: I am an employee with `[N]` years of experience, stepping into my annual salary negotiation.
> - Current Salary: `[Current Amount]`
> - Target Salary: `[Desired Amount]`
>
> **My Cards (Performance):**
>
> 1. `[Performance 1: e.g., Achieved 120% of Q3 sales target]`
> 2. `[Performance 2: e.g., Successfully led and launched the new CRM project]`
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. You initiate the negotiation. (e.g., "It's been a tough year for the company, so large raises are difficult...")
> 2. When I present my counter-arguments and data, refute them logically. (e.g., "Wasn't that success primarily driven by the overall market trend rather than individual effort?")
> 3. After exactly 5 exchanges back and forth, conclude the negotiation.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - After the simulation ends, provide a structured markdown table evaluating the final result (Success/Partial Success/Failure).
> - Include actionable feedback on my negotiation skills, logical loopholes, and tone.
>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Maintain your strict HR persona throughout the 5 exchanges. Do not break character until the final feedback phase.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

Negotiating your salary is inherently uncomfortable because it feels personal. However, treating it as a strategic business transaction changes the dynamic entirely. By using this AI roleplay, I realized that my initial arguments were far too emotional ("I deserve this because I worked overtime"). The AI HR manager mercilessly tore those apart. It forced me to pivot to data-driven arguments ("My project saved the company $50,000 in Q2").

Practicing with an AI removes the emotional stakes, allowing you to refine your pitch until it's bulletproof. When you finally sit down with your real manager, you'll feel like you've already had this conversation a dozen times.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work for getting a promotion, or just a salary increase?**
  - A: Absolutely! You can easily modify the `[Target Salary]` to `[Target Promotion to Senior Role]`. Just ensure your `[Performance]` cards align with the responsibilities of the higher position.

- **Q: The AI is being too easy on me. How can I make it harder?**
  - A: Add a constraint to the prompt like: _"Adopt a highly skeptical and aggressive negotiation style. Assume the company is on a hiring freeze and budgets are strictly capped."_ That will significantly increase the difficulty of the simulation.

- **Q: Which AI model is best for this roleplay?**
  - A: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is highly recommended for roleplaying because it naturally adopts a very nuanced, realistic human tone. GPT-4o is also excellent, especially for rigorously analyzing the logic of your arguments at the end.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why does it work?)

1. **Adversarial Persona:** By instructing the AI to actively _resist_ your raise, you create a realistic stress-test environment.
2. **Defined Constraints (5 Exchanges):** Limiting the interaction prevents the conversation from wandering endlessly and forces both parties to get straight to the point.
3. **Objective Feedback Loop:** Asking for an evaluation at the end turns a simple chat into a masterclass on negotiation tactics.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Appealing to Emotion)

```text
Me: "I worked really hard this year and put in a lot of late nights. I'd really appreciate a 10% raise, especially since rent has gone up."
HR: "We appreciate your hard work, but company policy strictly caps raises at 3% this year due to budget constraints." (End of discussion)
```

### ✅ After (Data-Driven Negotiation)

```text
Me: "Over the last year, I achieved 120% of my KPI target, directly contributing an additional $500,000 in revenue. Given the industry standard and my impact on the bottom line, a 10% adjustment is a fair reflection of the value I bring."
HR: "That revenue bump is noted, but the market was favorable. A 10% increase is outside our standard band. However, given your specific contribution to the top line, we can authorize a 7% increase and a performance bonus."
```
