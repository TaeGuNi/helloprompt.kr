# 🎬 YouTube Shorts Factory: Script + Visuals in 30 Seconds

- **🎯 Recommended for:** Marketers, YouTubers running out of daily upload ideas, Side-hustlers growing Shorts channels
- **⏱️ Time Required:** 30 minutes → 30 seconds
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (for natural, witty dialogue)

- ⭐ **Difficulty:** ⭐☆☆☆☆
- ⚡️ **Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 🚀 **Utility:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> _"Ah... what on earth should I film tomorrow? Sitting down to write the script is the hardest part of the day..."_

The core of Short-form video success (Shorts, Reels, TikTok) lies in two things: **'Relentless Consistency'** and **'Nailing the First 3 Seconds'**. But squeezing out viral ideas daily and scripting them perfectly isn't humanly sustainable. Now, let's inject the proven **'Viral Formula'** into AI and build a frictionless factory that prints out ready-to-shoot scripts just by feeding it a topic.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Understand the golden short-form formula (Hook - Body - CTA).
2. Command the AI to strictly enforce this structure and dictate the pacing.
3. Simply throw in a topic to instantly receive a complete shooting cue sheet, detailing both visual directions and audio scripts.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need a perfect, ready-to-read script complete with camera directions.

> **Role:** You are an elite Short-form Content PD and a master Copywriter. You excel at writing dopamine-inducing, fast-paced sentences that retain viewer attention.
>
> **Context:**

> - Goal: To create a script that maximizes watch time and drives engagement.
>
> **Task:**
> Write a 59-second Shorts script on the topic of `[Top 3 Hidden Daiso Gems]`. You must strictly follow this structure:
>
> 1. **Hook (0~3s):** A powerful punch to stop the scrolling immediately. Use a provocative question or a shocking fact.
> 2. **Body (4~50s):** High-density information delivery. Keep sentences punchy, fast, and rhythmic. Completely eliminate any boring introductions.
> 3. **CTA (51~59s):** A natural Call-to-Action to subscribe, save, or comment.

>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Do not include any standard greetings (like "Hello guys"). Start directly with the hook.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a game-changer because it forces the AI to think like a video director, not just a writer. The biggest mistake creators make when using AI for scripts is getting a "wall of text" that sounds like a Wikipedia article. By splitting the output into `Visual` and `Audio` columns, you instantly know what b-roll to shoot or what facial expression to make. This drastically cuts down your editing time because you aren't figuring out the visuals in post-production—you already have a visual blueprint. I highly recommend using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for this specific prompt, as it tends to write much more natural-sounding, conversational dialogue compared to other models.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with free AI models?**
  - A: Yes, it works fine on the free versions of ChatGPT or Claude. However, the pacing and humor in the Pro models (like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) are noticeably more nuanced and require much less human editing.

- **Q: Can I use this for Instagram Reels or TikTok too?**
  - A: Absolutely. The algorithm for short-form content is virtually identical across platforms. Just change the word "Shorts" in the prompt to "Reels" or "TikTok" if you want platform-specific CTAs (like "Save this audio to use later").

- **Q: The AI keeps writing intros that are too long. What should I do?**
  - A: Add a stricter constraint in the prompt: _"Do NOT say 'Hello' or introduce yourself. Start the very first word with the main conflict or the most shocking part of the story."_

## 🧬 Anatomy of the Prompt (Why it works)

1. **Forced Structure (Hook-Body-CTA):** By hardcoding the timestamps (e.g., Hook 0~3s), we physically restrict the AI from writing slow, meandering introductions that kill viewer retention.
2. **Visual/Audio Split:** A good video is an audiovisual medium. Directing the screen composition inside a Table format ensures the AI provides actionable shooting directions alongside the spoken words.
