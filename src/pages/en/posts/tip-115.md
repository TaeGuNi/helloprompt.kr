**Bokeh** refers to the phenomenon where light in the out-of-focus area forms soft blobs. Using **Shallow Depth of Field** fixes gaze on the subject and creates a romantic atmosphere.\_

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. `Bokeh`, `Blurry background` keywords are essential.
2. Use `Shallow depth of field` (shallow depth of field) or aperture values like `f/1.8`.
3. Night streets are best background to create colorful bokeh.
