_"What was the quadratic formula? b squared minus... was it 4ac or 2ac?"_

The human brain hates listing meaningless numbers and symbols. Instead, it likes stories and rhythms. This is why we remember names of Joseon kings (Tae-Jeong-Tae-Se-Mun-Dan-Se...) forever but forget formulas as soon as we turn around. This prompt puts 'story' and 'rhythm' on desolate formulas and forcibly pastes them into the brain.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Assign characters or meanings to each variable of the formula (Storytelling)
2. Convert to wordplay or song lyrics that stick to the mouth (Mnemonic)
3. One-line summary of formula derivation process to induce understanding-based memorization

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Quadratic Formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$"

### ✅ After (Result)

**[Story Memorization]**
"**Two(2)** **Ah(a)** sick went to hospital, gave **Mi(min)**nus **Bi(b)**tamin. **Plus(plus)**ed **Mi(minus)**nused looking inside **Root**, **Bi(b)** came **Two(2)** times and **Sa(4)** **Ah(a)** **Chi(c)** is there?"
-> "Over $2a$, $-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$"

**[Rhythm Memorization]**
(Mountain Rabbit Melody)
"Over Two-A(~2a)~ Minus B(~-b)
Plus-Ma Root(~±√) B-Squared(~b^2)
Minus Four-A-C(~-4ac)
Quadratic Formula Complete~"

**[Intuitive Understanding]**
"It means it is apart by the same distance left and right from the center (axis) of the quadratic function graph."

## 🎯 Conclusion

There is no royal road to study, but there is a knack to memorization. When others memorize writing blindly, you memorize humming rap.

Now leave work on time and go to coin karaoke! 🍷
