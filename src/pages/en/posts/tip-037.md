_"Assistant Manager Kim, who wrote this code, left 3 years ago, and there is no documentation."_

It's the scariest horror movie for developers.
Variable names are full of `a`, `b`, the logic is twisted, and it's like a time bomb that might explode if you touch it.
Don't cry. AI will decrypt that code and translate it into human language.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Detailed explanation of complex code flow in natural language
2. Business Logic Reverse Engineering
3. Identify potential risk factors in code

## 🚀 Solution: "Legacy Code Interpreter"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a software craftsman with 30 years of experience and a legacy code analysis expert.
> **Request:** AI analyzes complex legacy code line by line without documentation or comments and explains it in plain language.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a software craftsman with 30 years of experience and a legacy code analysis expert.
>
> **Context:** I have code to maintain, but it's hard to understand the logic because there are no comments and no author.
>
> **Task:**
> Analyze the code below and write the following contents:
>
> 1. **Summary:** Summarize roughly what this code does in 3 sentences.
> 2. **Detailed Logic:** Explain the flow of the code step by step as if explaining a Flowchart.
> 3. **Cautions:** If there are parts to be especially careful about when modifying (expected Side Effects), warn me.
>
> **Code:**
>
> ```
> [Paste code to interpret here]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Map development terms (variable names, etc.) with business terms in the explanation.
> - Explain with metaphors easily enough for an elementary school student to understand.

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Code - Obscure C style)

```c
int proc(int v) {
  int r = 1;
  while (v > 1) {
    r *= v--;
  }
  return r;
}
```

### ✅ After (Interpretation Result)

**📝 Summary:**
This code is a function that calculates the mathematical **Factorial**. It returns the product of all numbers from the input number down to 1.

**🔍 Detailed Logic:**

1. Set `r`, the variable to store the result, to 1.
2. Repeat while input `v` is greater than 1.
   - Multiply the current `v` value to `r`.
   - Decrease `v` by 1.
3. Return the finally calculated `r`.

**⚠️ Cautions:**
If the input value `v` is too large, the result value may exceed the integer (int) range, causing an **Overflow** and resulting in a strange negative value. When handling large numbers, you must change the type.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Legacy code can be a 'legacy' or a 'debt'.
Once understood with the help of AI, that hideous-looking code will look like traces of fierce contemplation by senior developers. (Or maybe not 😅) 🍷
