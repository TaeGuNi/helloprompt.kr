_"Are you relying only on national pension? It's time for a cold reality check."_

How much do you need to spend 3 million won a month after retirement? 1 billion? 2 billion? Vague fear helps nothing. If you input your current age, target retirement time, and expected living expenses, AI calculates the **'exact target amount'** considering inflation and investment return rate.
