_"Told to do competitor research but lost on where to start looking? Don't drown in the sea of information."_

Collecting information is important for market research, but the key is 'by what criteria' you analyze the collected information. It is much more efficient to ask AI for an analysis framework first, and then order it to organize information according to that framework.
