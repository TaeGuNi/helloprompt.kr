_"I want to take out complex descriptions and make simple and angular 3D characters."_

**Low Poly** is a 3D art style expressed angularly by reducing the number of polygons (faces), and **Voxel** is a style stacked with blocks like Lego or Minecraft. Both give a clean, modern, and cute feeling.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. `Low poly` is an origami feeling with split faces, `Voxel` is a block stacking feeling.
2. It becomes cleaner when used with `Minimalist`, `Flat shading`.
3. It's a perfect match with `Isometric view`.
