## 🚀 Solution: "Personal Yoga Teacher"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you just need a quick, no-fuss routine to get started.

> **Role:** You are an expert yoga instructor specializing in rehabilitation therapy and beginners.
>
> **Request:** Please create a gentle, easy-to-follow, 15-minute home yoga sequence for someone with a very stiff body who is too intimidated to attend a public yoga class.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you want a highly detailed, personalized sequence tailored to your exact physical condition.

> **Role:** You are a senior yoga instructor with extensive knowledge of rehabilitation therapy and anatomy. You excel at creating gentle, restorative sequences that inflexible individuals can follow without strain.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - Background: I am an office worker who sits at a desk for over 8 hours a day. My `[shoulders and neck]` are extremely stiff, and my `[pelvis]` feels tight and sore. My current flexibility level is that `[my hands can only reach my knees when I bend over]`.
> - Goal: I want to safely improve my flexibility and relieve daily tension.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Plan a **15-minute home yoga sequence** specifically designed to relieve tension and incrementally increase flexibility in my problem areas.
> 2. Structure the session logically: Introduction (Centering/Breathing) → Warm-up → Main Sequence → Cool-down (Savasana).
> 3. Provide clear **'Posture Tips'** and specific **'Breathing Timing (Inhale/Exhale)'** for every single movement.
> 4. For any pose that might be challenging, provide a highly accessible **modification** suited for absolute beginners.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Avoid complex jargon. If you use Sanskrit terms, you must pair them with simple English translations (e.g., Adho Mukha Svanasana -> Downward-Facing Dog).
> - Present the routine in a clean, easy-to-read Markdown format.
>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Do not recommend advanced poses like headstands or deep backbends that could cause injury to a beginner. Prioritize safety and gentle stretching.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is incredibly effective because it explicitly addresses the "fear of failure" that many beginners face with yoga. By stating your limitations (e.g., "my hands can only reach my knees"), you force the AI to recalibrate its definition of a "beginner."

In practice, specifying your daily habits (like sitting for 8 hours) allows the AI to select poses that counteract your specific lifestyle strains, such as tight hip flexors and rounded shoulders. If a suggested pose is still too hard, simply reply to the AI: _"Pose #3 is still too painful for my lower back. Give me an even easier alternative."_ The AI will instantly adapt the routine, ensuring you never feel discouraged.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Do I need the paid version of ChatGPT for this?**
  - A: Not at all! The free versions of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/4o-mini), Claude, and Gemini are more than capable of generating excellent, safe yoga sequences.
- **Q: How often should I use this sequence?**
  - A: Consistency is key. Try doing this exact 15-minute routine every evening for a week. Once your body adapts, you can ask the AI to "slightly increase the difficulty" for your next week's sequence.

- **Q: What if I don't know how to perform the pose the AI suggests?**
  - A: You can ask the AI to "Describe the movement step-by-step as if explaining it to a child," or simply search the English name of the pose on YouTube for a quick visual demonstration.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Vulnerability as Context:** By honestly describing your physical limitations (`hands only reach knees`), the AI avoids standard, templated yoga routines and builds one strictly for your mobility level.
2. **Safety Constraints:** The explicit warning against advanced poses ensures the AI acts responsibly, minimizing the risk of injury for someone practicing alone at home.
3. **Structured Flow:** Mandating a professional structure (Breathing → Warm-up → Main → Cool-down) ensures you get a holistic yoga experience, not just a random list of stretches.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Simple Input)

> "Recommend some yoga stretches for a beginner."

_(The AI often recommends standard poses like Chaturanga or full Sun Salutations, which require significant upper body strength and hamstring flexibility that a stiff beginner doesn't have.)_

### ✅ After (Using the Pro Prompt)

_(The AI generates a customized, hyper-accessible routine.)_

**[15-Minute Restorative Sequence for Desk Workers]**

1. **Child's Pose (Balasana) - Modification:** (2 mins)
   - _Breathing:_ Inhale deeply into your back body, exhale and let your hips sink toward your heels.
   - _Posture Tip:_ If your hips don't touch your heels, that's completely fine. Widen your knees to create space for your belly and relax your neck.
2. **Seated Neck & Shoulder Rolls:** (2 mins)
   - _Breathing:_ Inhale as you lift your shoulders to your ears, exhale as you roll them down your back.
   - _Posture Tip:_ Keep your spine straight; do not force your neck beyond a comfortable stretch.
3. **Cat-Cow Stretch:** (Repeat 10 times)
   - _Breathing:_ Inhale as you drop your belly and lift your chest (Cow), exhale as you round your spine toward the ceiling (Cat).
   - _Posture Tip:_ Move slowly, visualizing the movement of each individual vertebra.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Flexibility isn't about perfectly mimicking an Instagram yogi; it's about reconnecting with your own body and releasing stored tension. With an AI instructor, you can practice at your own pace, in your own living room, without any judgment. Roll out your mat, take a deep breath, and let the healing begin. Namaste! 🙏
