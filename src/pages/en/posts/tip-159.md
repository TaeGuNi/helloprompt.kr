### 📉 Debt Repayment Strategy Proposal: 'Avalanche Strategy' (Interest Saving First)

**1. Recommended Strategy: Avalanche Method**
Since the card loan interest rate is very high at 18%, if you leave it alone, the interest will snowball. I strongly recommend turning off high-interest loans first for **"Interest Cost Minimization"** rather than psychological satisfaction.

**2. Repayment Priority**
1. 🥇 **Loan A (Card Loan):** Rate 18% (Most Urgent!)
2. 🥈 **Loan C (Credit Loan):** Rate 6%
3. 🥉 **Loan B (Jeonse Loan):** Rate 4%

**3. Simulation (When paying 1.5 million monthly)**
- **Step 1:** If you go all-in with 1.5 million on Loan A (3 million), **full payment in about 2~3 months** is possible.
- **Effect:** High-interest bad debt disappears in just 3 months, and credit score will rise. Focus 1.5 million on repaying Loan C after that.
