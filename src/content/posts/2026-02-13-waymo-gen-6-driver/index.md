Waymo has officially commenced fully autonomous operations with its **6th-generation Driver**, a milestone that signals the company's shift from validation to massive scale. This latest system is engineered to be the primary engine for Waymo's expansion into more cities and diverse environments, including those with extreme winter weather.

### Built on 200 Million Miles

The Gen 6 Driver is the culmination of seven years of commercial service and nearly **200 million autonomous miles** driven in complex urban environments. Waymo emphasizes that "demonstrably safe AI requires equally resilient inputs," underpinning their decision to stick with a custom, multi-modal sensing suite rather than relying on cameras alone.

### Hardware Breakthroughs

The new system delivers higher performance at a significantly lower cost, a critical factor for scaling the fleet to tens of thousands of vehicles.
- **Vision:** At the core are custom **17-megapixel imagers** that offer superior resolution and dynamic range compared to standard automotive cameras. The system sees more with less, using fewer than half the number of cameras found on the previous generation.
- **Lidar:** Waymo continues to bet on Lidar for 3D precision. The Gen 6 system leverages cost reductions in the industry while improving fidelity and robustness, allowing the vehicle to see through heavy road spray and fog.
- **Radar:** Advanced imaging radar creates dense maps to track object velocity and size instantly, providing crucial redundancy in severe weather.
- **Audio:** External Audio Receivers (EARs) allow the vehicle to hear and localize sirens before emergency vehicles are even visible.

### Platform Agnostic and Scalable

The 6th-generation Driver is designed to be vehicle-agnostic. It is currently being integrated into the dedicated robotaxi platform (often referred to as the Ojai) and the Hyundai IONIQ 5. 

Production is ramping up at Waymo's factory in Metro Phoenix, which is gearing up for a capacity of tens of thousands of units per year. By streamlining the hardware and collaborating directly with OEMs to make vehicles "Waymo Driver ready," the company is unlocking the economies of scale necessary to bring autonomous ride-hailing to the mass market.
