## Cracks in the Excel Empire

Microsoft Excel, the standard language of the business world for the past 30 years, is facing an unprecedented crisis due to the rapid development of Generative AI.

With AI agents handling data analysis and visualization, the need for manual spreadsheet manipulation is declining. Instead of memorizing complex formulas, users simply ask AI to "plot last month's sales trend."

## From Calculator to Assistant

Users now want solvers, not just tools.
* **Automated Cleaning:** AI fixes broken data instantly.
* **Insights:** AI finds anomalies faster than humans.
* **Natural Language:** No need for VLOOKUP anymore.

Microsoft is responding with Copilot, but the paradigm shift from direct manipulation to delegation poses a significant challenge to the legacy of Excel.
