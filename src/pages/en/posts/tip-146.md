_"If you can't explain it, you don't understand it." - Richard Feynman_

If you only read books with your eyes, it's easy to mistake that you 'know' (illusion of fluency). But when you actually try to explain, words don't come out. The Feynman technique is a study method of teaching assuming "explaining to an imaginary elementary school student". Now, don't mumble to the wall, teach an AI student.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. User easily explains what they studied to AI.
2. AI pretends not to understand and throws sharp questions (poking blind spots).
3. Identify parts where explanation gets stuck and designate 'Re-learning' points.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Studying Alone)

"Theory of relativity... Time is relative. Okay, memorized it all." (Can't remember in the exam room)

### ✅ After (Prompt Training)

**Me:** "If you move fast, time slows down."
**AI (Kid):** "Why? Is the clock broken?"
**Me:** "No, not that... The speed of light is always constant so..."
**AI (Kid):** "What does light have to do with time?"
**Me:** (Speechless) "Uh... right? I don't know this." -> **(Open textbook again)**
