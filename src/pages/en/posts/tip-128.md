## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"I look forward to hear from you soon."

> (Common mistake)

### ✅ After (Result)

**[Correction]**
"I look forward to **hearing** from you soon."

**[Correction Note]**

- **To hear → To hearing**: 'to' in 'look forward to' is a **preposition**, not infinitive. So gerund (-ing) must follow.

**[Native Expression]**

1. "I hope to hear from you soon." (Casual)
2. "Your prompt response would be appreciated." (Formal)

> (Perfect correction and explanation)
