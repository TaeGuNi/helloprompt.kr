>
> **Scenario:**
>
> 1. Attack me first: "Unfortunately, we can't match that figure based on our internal salary band."
> 2. When I give defense logic (performance, market value), dig deeper.
> 3. Never say "Okay" easily. Concede only after at least 3 turns of back-and-forth conversation.
>
> **Feedback:**
> After simulation, give cold feedback on my attitude (Lack of confidence, weak evidence, etc.).
>
> **Ready? Throw the first punch.**

## 🧬 Anatomy of Prompt (Why it works?)

1.  **Adversarial Persona:** We set AI as an 'Enemy', not a 'Helper'. This forces AI to dig into your logical flaws.
2.  **Force 3 Turns:** AI is too nice and usually agrees after one counter. By constraining "Endure at least 3 turns", we create a sticky negotiation environment.
3.  **Post-Feedback:** Don't just spar. Coaching like "You sounded too defensive earlier" improves your skill.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (No Prep)

**HR:** "50k is difficult due to equity issues..."
**Me:** "Ah... okay... then 45k...?"
(Result: Salary Frozen 📉)

### ✅ After (Fought AI 10 times)

**HR:** "50k is difficult due to equity issues..."
**Me:** "I fully understand. However, considering I increased revenue by 20% in my last project, this figure is a reasonable investment compared to market average. If base salary is burdensome, can we discuss Signing Bonus or Stock Options?"
**HR:** (Eyes shaking) "...Let me check with the Director."
(Result: 20% Increase 📈)

## 🎯 Conclusion

Negotiation is not a 'Fight', it's 'Business'.
But business without prep is failure.

Get beaten by AI 10 times tonight.
Tomorrow, the number on the contract changes.
**Your value is determined the moment you open your mouth.** 🍷
