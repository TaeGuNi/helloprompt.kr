How much do you actually need to comfortably spend $3,000 (or 3 million KRW) a month after retirement? One million dollars? Two million? Vague anxiety won't secure your future. By inputting your current age, target retirement age, and expected living expenses, AI can calculate your **'Exact Target Amount'**—factoring in inflation and investment return rates.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

When it comes to retirement planning, the biggest enemy is ambiguity. People often throw around arbitrary numbers like "I need a million dollars to retire," without understanding the math behind it. This prompt is powerful because it forces the AI to act as a rigorous financial calculator, accounting for silent wealth-killers like inflation while balancing it against compound interest.

I highly recommend running this prompt with different variables (e.g., changing your target retirement age from 60 to 65, or tweaking your expected return rate). This kind of scenario testing (a simplified Monte Carlo simulation) will immediately show you the immense value of starting your investments just a few years earlier. It transforms abstract financial anxiety into a concrete, manageable monthly goal.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use this prompt for a different currency, like Euros or Yen?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just replace the currency and the specific pension system (e.g., from US Social Security/Korea National Pension to your local equivalent) in the context brackets `[ ]`. The mathematical principles of compound interest and inflation remain identical.

- **Q: What if I don't know my expected pension amount?**
  - A: You can either set it to `[0]` for a worst-case scenario calculation, or ask the AI to estimate an average payout for your region based on your current income bracket.

- **Q: Are the AI's financial calculations 100% accurate?**
  - A: Conversational AIs are language models, not dedicated calculators. While models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are generally excellent at following these formulas, you should always double-check the final math with a spreadsheet or a real financial advisor before making major life decisions.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1.  **Role Assignment:** By designating the AI as a "Certified Financial Planner," we elevate its output from generic advice to structured, professional financial modeling.
2.  **Clear Assumptions:** Hardcoding variables like inflation (2%) and realistic returns (7% pre-retirement, 4% post-retirement) prevents the AI from making wild guesses and ensures the math is grounded in reality.
3.  **Actionable Outputs:** Reversing the calculation to find the _monthly savings required_ gives the user an immediate, actionable takeaway rather than just a daunting final target number.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
How much do I need to retire? I want to spend 3 million KRW monthly.
```

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
### 👴 35-Year-Old's Retirement Simulation (Target Age: 60)

**1. Future Living Expense Calculation**
- Current Target: 3 Million KRW/month ➡️ **Required at Age 60: 4.92 Million KRW/month** (Assuming 2% annual inflation)

**2. Total Necessary Retirement Fund**
- Shortfall (Excluding National Pension) from age 60 to 90 (30 years)
- **Target Asset Size Required: Approximately 1.25 Billion KRW**

**3. The Solution: How much do you need to save monthly?**
- Assuming current assets are 0, investing for 25 years with a 7% annual return
- **👉 You need to invest approximately 1.55 Million KRW every month starting today.**

**💡 Expert Advice:**
If investing 1.55 Million KRW monthly is currently unfeasible, consider delaying your retirement to age 65 or increasing your initial lump-sum investment. Time is your greatest asset in compound interest.
