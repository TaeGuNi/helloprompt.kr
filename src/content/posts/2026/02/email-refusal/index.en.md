## 🚀 Solution: "The Gentle Decline"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this for simple, everyday rejections like passing on cold outreach or declining meeting requests.

> **Role:** You are a `[Business Communication Expert]`.
> **Task:** Draft a polite but firm refusal email in response to a `[proposal/meeting request]` sent to my company. The core reason for declining is `[budget constraints/scheduling conflicts]`.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this for high-stakes communications, important partners, or any situation where safeguarding the long-term relationship is critical.

> **Role:** You are a `[20-year Veteran PR Director]`. You excel at utilizing sophisticated, diplomatic language that clearly communicates the company's boundaries without offending the recipient.
>
> **Context:**
>
> - **Recipient:** `[A Company's Marketing Manager]` (We briefly met at the recent industry conference).
> - **Proposal:** `[A joint promotional campaign for our new product line]`.
> - **Reason for Refusal:** `[Due to a severe internal resource shortage, initiating new external partnerships is impossible for the first half of the year]`.
> - **Goal:** Firmly decline the current proposal, but deliberately leave the door open for potential collaboration in the second half of the year to preserve the relationship.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Open with a warm greeting, explicitly expressing gratitude for the time and effort put into their proposal.
> 2. Articulate the reason for the refusal honestly yet professionally (lack of available resources).
> 3. Tactfully propose revisiting the conversation in the 'Second Half (around September)'.
> 4. Enclose any placeholder text `[like names, titles, or dates]` in brackets so I can easily fill them in.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Tone & Manner: Exceptionally polite, professional, empathetic, yet definitive.
> - Output Format: Provide only the final 'Email Body' text, ready to be copied and pasted.
>
> **Warning:**
>
> - Do not over-explain or make the refusal sound like a defensive excuse. Keep the justification concise and confident.

## 💡 Writer's Insight

The secret to a flawless refusal email is validation. You must implicitly convey: **"Your proposal is valuable, but our timing is off."** This shifts the narrative from a personal rejection to a situational constraint.

By utilizing this specific prompt, the AI perfectly executes the 'cushioning' technique.
**Pro Tip:** Even though the AI generates a fantastic draft, always manually add a brief, personalized closing sentence (e.g., "Wishing you the best with your upcoming Q2 launch" or "Stay warm in this freezing weather!"). That tiny human touch solidifies the authenticity of the message and proves a human reviewed it.

## 🙋 FAQ

- **Q: Is it better to provide a specific reason, or keep it vague?**
  - A: Specificity is almost always better. Providing a concrete, irrefutable reason like 'Q1 budget lock' or 'resource allocation' helps the recipient understand the decision isn't personal, allowing them to move on cleanly without feeling strung along.

- **Q: Can I use this for internal emails, like declining a project from another department?**
  - A: Absolutely. Just adjust the `[Context]` variables. Change the 'Recipient' to 'Internal Stakeholder' and modify the 'Reason' to reflect your current sprint capacity.

- **Q: Can the AI write this in another language for international clients?**
  - A: Yes! Simply add "Output the final email in [Target Language]" to the Constraints section.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works)

1.  **The Veteran Persona:** Assigning the role of a "Veteran PR Director" forces the AI to select elevated, diplomatic vocabulary rather than abrupt, transactional phrasing.
2.  **Relational Context:** Feeding the AI details like "We met at the conference" allows it to generate a personalized hook, making the email feel far less automated.
3.  **Future Pacing:** Instructing the AI to "leave the door open for the second half" transforms a hard stop into a strategic pause, safeguarding your professional network for future endeavors.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Common Bad Example)

```text
Hi,
I reviewed your proposal. Unfortunately, it doesn't align with our current goals, so we will have to pass.
Thanks.
```

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

```text
Dear [A Company's Marketing Manager],

It is wonderful to reconnect with you after our brief meeting at the recent industry conference.

Our team has carefully reviewed your proposal regarding the [joint promotional campaign for our new product line]. While we found your ideas highly engaging and see clear value in the concept, we are unfortunately unable to move forward with a partnership at this time.

Currently, all of our internal resources are fully allocated for the first half of the year, making it impossible for us to dedicate the attention your project deserves.

We deeply appreciate you thinking of us for this opportunity. If your timeline allows, I would welcome the chance to revisit this conversation in the second half of the year (around September) when our bandwidth opens up.

Wishing you and your team continued success in the meantime.

Warm regards,

[OpenClaw]
[Your Title]
```
