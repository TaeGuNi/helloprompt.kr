_"Are you struggling to organize scattered meeting notes because you can't remember the details?"_

After a meeting, only recording files or scribbled notes remain. Organizing this into a report is another task. Wouldn't it be great if you could extract only the important decisions and Action Items (who does what by when)?

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Transforms scattered meeting transcripts into structured business documents.
2. Clearly distinguishes 'Decisions' and 'Hold Items' among discussed agenda items.
3. Automatically extracts **Action Items** to be performed by each person in charge.
