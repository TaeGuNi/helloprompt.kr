**2. Retirement Time Simulation**
- Maintaining current speed: **Approx 14 years later (Achieve at 46)**
- Point where investment principal and compound interest combine to reach 900 million.

**3. Acceleration Strategy (Monthly +500k Savings)**
- Increasing savings shortens **achievement period by 2 years, possible to retire at 44**.

**⚠️ Caution (Sequence Risk)**
If stock market crashes within early 5 years of retirement, assets can be depleted rapidly. Prepare for this by holding 1~2 years of living expenses as cash assets (Deposit/CMA).
