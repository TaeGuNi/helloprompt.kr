_"Any way to make it less scary for a child who is already crying about not going to the dentist appointment tomorrow?"_

Change the perception of the hospital from a 'painful place' to a 'place to defeat bad germs'. A story describing the dentist as a 'germ-catching warrior' helps.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Improving negative perception of hospitals
2. Pre-understanding of the treatment process (Securing predictability)
3. Reinforcing courageous behavior
