_"It worked fine until yesterday... why on earth is it not working now?"_

The scariest bugs are those that malfunction quietly without error messages, or bugs that seem so obvious that you can't find the cause.
Is it too complicated to explain to a colleague, and you're suffering alone?
If you throw the logs and code to the AI, it might find the cause in an unexpected place.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Error log analysis and cause inference
2. Proposed fixed code
3. Recurrence prevention tips

## 🚀 Solution: "Sherlock Holmes Debugger"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a 'Sherlock Holmes' level developer who is a genius at debugging and sees through system architecture.
> **Request:** AI finds the cause for bugs you can't understand just by looking at logs, given stack traces and code snippets.

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below to use.

> **Role:** You are a 'Sherlock Holmes' level developer who is a genius at debugging and sees through system architecture.
>
> **Context:** An unexpected error occurred in my program. I'm in trouble because I can't find the cause.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Analyze the provided **error log** and **related code** and present the Root Cause of the bug as 3 hypotheses.
> 2. Write the **fixed code** that can solve the most likely cause.
> 3. Explain why this problem occurred in a way that even a beginner can understand.
>
> **Error Log:**
>
> ```
> [Paste error messages or stack traces here]
> ```
>
> **Related Code:**
>
> ```
> [Paste the code suspected of being the problem here]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Don't just say "I fixed it," but logically explain "why it broke."
> - If there is sensitive information (passwords, keys, etc.) for security, mask it and mention it.

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Situation)

**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`
**Code:**

```javascript
function renderList(data) {
  return data.users.map((user) => `<li>${user.name}</li>`);
}
```

### ✅ After (Result)

**Analysis:** The `map` function was called while `data.users` does not exist (undefined) or is not an array. It's highly likely that the API response hasn't arrived yet or the format has changed.

**Fixed Code:**

```javascript
function renderList(data) {
  // Using optional chaining and default values
  const users = data?.users || [];

  if (users.length === 0) return "<p>No users found.</p>";
  return users.map((user) => `<li>${user.name}</li>`);
}
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Don't work overtime to catch bugs.
Request an investigation from the AI detective, and all you have to do is cleanly apply the resolved code. The culprit is right in here! 🍷
