Google has announced a significant upgrade to **Gemini 3 Deep Think**, its specialized reasoning mode designed to tackle complex challenges in science, research, and engineering. The update bridges the gap between abstract theoretical capability and practical application, empowering researchers to solve problems where data is messy, incomplete, or lacks a single correct solution.

### Pushing the Boundaries of Science

Deep Think has been refined in partnership with scientists to handle rigorous academic tasks. Early testers have already reported breakthrough results:
- **Rutgers University:** Mathematician Lisa Carbone used Deep Think to identify a subtle logical flaw in a highly technical mathematics paper—a flaw that had previously slipped through human peer review.
- **Duke University:** The Wang Lab utilized the model to optimize fabrication methods for crystal growth, designing a recipe for semiconductor materials that met precise targets previous methods could not achieve.
- **Google R&D:** Internal teams are using Deep Think to accelerate the design of physical components for devices.

### Benchmarking Intelligence

The updated model sets new standards across a wide range of academic and competitive benchmarks:
- **Humanity’s Last Exam:** Scored **48.4%** (without tools), pushing the limits of modern frontier models.
- **ARC-AGI-2:** Achieved an unprecedented **84.6%**, verified by the ARC Prize Foundation.
- **Codeforces:** Attained a staggering **Elo of 3455**, demonstrating elite competitive programming skills.
- **Olympiads:** Reached gold-medal level performance in the 2025 International Math, Physics, and Chemistry Olympiads.

### From Theory to Reality

Beyond solving equations, Deep Think is built for engineering utility. It can interpret complex data and model physical systems through code. In one demonstration, the model turned a simple sketch into a 3D-printable file, analyzing the drawing to model the complex shape required for physical production.

### Availability

Starting today, the updated Deep Think mode is available to **Google AI Ultra subscribers** in the Gemini app. For the first time, Google is also opening access to developers, researchers, and enterprises via the **Gemini API** through an early access program.

This release signals a shift towards AI that doesn't just process information but actively participates in the scientific method, offering reasoning capabilities that can act as a true partner in discovery and innovation.
