_"Not a cliché dragon, I need a monster that could actually exist in an ecosystem."_

Monsters in Monster Hunter or The Witcher series are charming because they feel like 'living creatures', not just enemies. Let's create realistic creatures considering habitat, diet, and attack patterns.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input the monster's habitat and motif (animal/insect/plant).
2. AI generates appearance, hunting method, weakness, and **'ecological features'**.
3. Provides loot information to cover game elements.

## 🧬 Why it works?

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Swamp crocodile monster."

### ✅ After (Result)

- **Name:** **Mud Stalker**
- **Appearance:** Its shell is covered in moss and mud, making it indistinguishable from the swamp floor. Instead of jaws, it has a long, straw-like snout.
- **Habit:** Lies dormant underwater, then fires its snout to suck body fluids when it senses a shadow passing by.
- **Weakness:** Shell is hard, but attacking the red sac inside its throat when it opens its mouth is a critical hit.
- **Loot:** **Stalker's Mucus Sac** (Used as strong adhesive or poison potion ingredient).
