OpenAI has officially launched **GPT-5.3 Codex Spark**, a new model optimized specifically for developers. This release focuses on revolutionizing the real-time coding experience in IDE environments, boasting inference speeds three times faster than previous models and significantly improved code understanding.

## Key Features

### 1. Ultra-Low Latency

True to its name, Codex Spark boasts a latency of **under 15ms**. This means it can suggest code in real-time as the developer types, eliminating the need to wait for AI responses.

### 2. Project-Level Context Awareness

Going beyond single-file analysis, it understands the entire project structure. Efficiently utilizing a window of up to **200k tokens**, it accurately references and suggests functions or classes defined in other files.

### 3. Enhanced Debugging and Refactoring

Beyond simple code generation, it detects potential bugs in existing code in real-time and offers fix suggestions. Additionally, refactoring capabilities to convert legacy code into modern syntax have been strengthened.

## How to Use

GPT-5.3 Codex Spark is available starting today via API and major IDE plugins.
