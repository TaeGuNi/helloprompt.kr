_"Of the 1 million won I pay every month, how much is principal and how much is interest?"_

There are two main ways to repay a loan. **'Equal Principal and Interest Repayment'**, where you pay the same amount every month, and **'Equal Principal Repayment'**, where the amount decreases over time. Which one is better for me? If you create a full repayment schedule using Excel financial functions (`PMT`, `IPMT`, `PPMT`), you can see the difference in total interest at a glance.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Auto-calculate monthly payment (principal + interest) with `PMT` function.
2. Separate interest and principal portions with `IPMT` and `PPMT` functions.
3. Create a schedule showing balance changes by repayment installment (1st ~ 360th).

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
How do I calculate loan interest in Excel?
```

### ✅ After (Result)

````text
### 🏦 Excel Loan Repayment Formulas

**1. Money paid every month (Total Principal + Interest)**
```text
=PMT($B$2/12, $B$3*12, -$B$1)
```
````

_Result: Approx. 1,036,384 KRW (You pay this much every month)_

**2. How much is interest? (Based on 1st installment)**

- Assuming column A has the installment number (1, 2, 3...):

```text
=IPMT($B$2/12, A5, $B$3*12, -$B$1)
```

_(A5 is the current installment. Drag down)_

**3. How much is principal?**

```text
=PPMT($B$2/12, A5, $B$3*12, -$B$1)
```

**💡 Analysis:**
Initially, `IPMT` (interest) is large and `PPMT` (principal) is small, but over time, you can see the principal repayment portion increasing.
