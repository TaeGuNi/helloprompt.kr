When tech expo season like CES arrives, newsfeeds get flooded with robots. Smart home robots from LG and Samsung make cute expressions, looking like they're ready to take over our household chores immediately. The media calls this the arrival of "Physical AI," praising that Large Language Models (LLMs) have finally gained a body.

However, the engineering reality hidden behind glossy demo videos is much colder and harder.

## Media Fantasy vs. Engineering Reality

Media wants to portray robots like Iron Man's Jarvis or Star Wars' C-3PO. The phrase "AI that thinks and moves on its own" is enough to excite investors and the public. But between software AI and Physical AI, there lies an uncrossable "physical river."

Asking ChatGPT to "peel an apple" is easy. But for a robot arm to actually peel an apple, it must overcome hundreds of hurdles.

1.  **Uncertainty of Perception:** Even a slight change in lighting can make a camera mistake an apple for a baseball.
2.  **Complexity of Control:** It must adjust the gripping force (torque) in milliseconds depending on the thickness of the apple skin and the firmness of the flesh.
3.  **Battery and Heat:** Processing all these calculations and running motors requires immense power. This is why demo robots often run out of battery in 15 minutes or stop due to overheating.

## Moravec's Paradox is Still Alive

Hans Moravec's paradox from the 1980s, "It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility," is still valid in 2026.

Thanks to LLMs, it has become easy for robots to "write poems and code." But "folding laundry or doing dishes" remains the Mount Everest of robotics. The functions as 'companion appliances' shown by LG and Samsung robots are excellent, but they are far from the 'all-purpose housekeepers' implied by the media. A tablet with wheels and a butler with hands are problems of entirely different dimensions.

## Time to Adjust Expectations

Physical AI is definitely the future. The progress shown by Tesla's Optimus or Boston Dynamics' Atlas is amazing. But that progress is not a magical leap, but the result of blood and sweat built up by modifying one screw and one line of code at a time.

Rather than the exaggerated fanfare of the media, we should pay more attention to the reality of engineers silently fighting gravity, friction, and battery efficiency. Because true innovation is happening very slowly in grease-stained labs, not on flashy stages.
