_"Are you staying up all night adjusting line spacing and font sizes when you're busy enough filling in the content?"_

Design comes later. First, the **Structure of the content** must be set. If you convert text chunks into clean Markdown syntax, it becomes much easier to paste into Notion or convert to PDF.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Throw unorganized resume text to the AI.
2. It converts it into a highly readable Markdown format (headers, bullet points, emphasis).
