# Generative UI: Beyond Static Interfaces

For a long time, we have used static interfaces predefined by designers. However, with the advancement of AI, UI is evolving into 'Generative UI', which is created in real-time according to the user's intent and context.

## Limitations of Static UI

Existing UIs show the same screen to every user. While this ensures consistency, it has limitations in meeting the unique needs of individual users.

## What is Generative UI?

Generative UI is a technology where AI analyzes user behavior, preferences, and current context to arrange UI elements and apply styles on the fly.

## Design of the Future

Designers will no longer draw screens but design the rules and constraints of the system. Generative UI will fundamentally change how humans interact with computers, beyond simple convenience.
