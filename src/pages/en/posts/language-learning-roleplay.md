## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

```text
I want to study English. Let's do a cafe situation drama. You be the staff.
```

<br>

### ✅ After (Result)

```text
**AI (Staff):** "Hi there! What can I get for you today?"

**Me:** "I want Americano. Ice please."

**AI (Staff):** "Sure, an Iced Americano. What size would you like? Tall, Grande, or Venti?"

**Me:** "Grande. And take out."

**AI (Staff):** "Got it. Anything else to eat?"

**(Feedback after conversation ends)**
---------------------------------------------------
💡 **Correction Note**
1. "I want Americano." -> **"Can I get an Iced Americano, please?"** (A more polite and natural expression.)
2. "And take out." -> **"To go, please."** (In the US, 'To go' is used much more than take out.)
---------------------------------------------------
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Don't be afraid of being wrong. AI won't laugh at you. Repeat and practice infinitely to speak coolly in real situations.
