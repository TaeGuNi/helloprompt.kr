\_"I want to create an image that overwhelms with form and atmosphere rather than detail."

You don't have to show everything. By making the subject a **Silhouette** using **Backlighting**, you can stimulate the audience's imagination and give a strong visual impact.\_

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Express the subject in black with `Silhouette`, `Backlit` keywords.
2. Background must be a bright light source like `Sunset`, `Bright moon`, `Explosion`.
