## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Question: Why do penguins have no knees?)

"Because their legs are short." (Boring)

### ✅ After (Result)

- **Scientific Approach:** Actually, penguins do have knees! They are just hidden under fur and fat, and because they always walk in a squatting position, they appear to be missing. If you take an X-ray, you can see very sturdy knee bones.
- **Philosophical Approach:** Penguins bent their knees themselves to avoid falling on the cold and slippery ice. Does it not show that only those who humbly lower themselves survive in the harshest environments?
- **One-Line Summary:** "Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Like your bank account balance."
