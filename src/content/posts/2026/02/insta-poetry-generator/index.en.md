## 💡 Writer's Insight

Creating viral text content for social media isn't just about rhyming words; it's about capturing a universal human experience in the fewest words possible. This prompt shines because it explicitly asks for different _styles_ of poetry. A witty twist might work best for a funny Reel, while the comforting tone is perfect for late-night aesthetic stories. I highly recommend using the "Background Image Concept" output as an exact prompt for image generators like Midjourney or DALL-E. It turns a simple text generation task into a complete, automated content creation pipeline.

## 🙋 FAQ

- **Q: Does this work well in languages other than English?**
  - A: Absolutely. While this prompt is in English, you can simply add "Please write the poetry in [Language]" to the Constraints section. AI models are surprisingly adept at capturing poetic nuance across various languages.

- **Q: My AI's output sounds too robotic or cheesy. How do I fix this?**
  - A: Tweak the "Topic" and "Tone" variables to be hyper-specific. Instead of saying "Sad," try "The specific kind of sadness when your coffee gets cold." The more specific and human your input is, the less cliché the AI's output will be.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** Positioning the AI as a "viral copywriter with millions of followers" forces it to prioritize engagement and readability over traditional, rigid poetry formats.
2. **Distinct Variations:** Asking for specific styles (Witty/Twist vs. Comforting) ensures you aren't stuck with a one-size-fits-all output, giving you immediate A/B testing options.
3. **Cross-Media Output:** Requesting visual concepts alongside the text turns this from a simple writing tool into a full-stack social media asset generator.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Simple Input)

"I want to lose weight but I'm hungry." _(Too simple, lacks emotional punch)_

### ✅ After (Generated using Pro Version - Style 1: Witty/Twist)

**[Topic: Dieting | Tone: Frustrated & Witty]**

My brain says,  
"We know the calories."

My stomach says,  
"I don't know her."

Today,  
We let the stomach win.
