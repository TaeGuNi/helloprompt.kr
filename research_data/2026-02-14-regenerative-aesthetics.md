# Research Report: Regenerative Aesthetics Trends 2026

## Topic: Polynucleotides (PN) vs. Exosomes

### 1. Overview

The shift from "corrective" (fillers/toxins) to "regenerative" (biostimulation) is the dominant trend in 2026 dermatology.

### 2. Key Agents

#### A. Polynucleotides (PN)

- **Source:** DNA fragments derived from salmon or trout sperm (highly compatible with human DNA).
- **Mechanism:** Agonist to adenosine A2A receptors.
- **Effects:**
  - Stimulates fibroblast proliferation.
  - Increases collagen and elastin synthesis.
  - Promotes angiogenesis (blood vessel formation).
  - Strong anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.
- **Primary Use:** Under-eye rejuvenation (replacing tear trough fillers), skin quality improvement, acne scarring.

#### B. Exosomes

- **Source:** Extracellular vesicles derived from stem cells (plant, adipose, or umbilical).
- **Mechanism:** Paracrine signaling; transferring mRNA, miRNA, and proteins to recipient cells to alter behavior.
- **Effects:**
  - massive reduction in inflammation.
  - "Resetting" aged cells to a younger phenotype.
  - Accelerating turnover and barrier repair.
- **Primary Use:** Post-procedure recovery (microneedling/laser), inflammatory skin diseases (eczema/rosacea), hair restoration.

### 3. Comparative Analysis

- **Structure vs. Signal:** PN provides the "bricks" (nucleotides) and mild stimulation. Exosomes provide the "architectural plans" (signals).
- **Regulatory Status (2026 Context):** PNs are widely approved as medical devices (Class III). Exosomes face stricter regulation regarding source stability and standardization, often classified as topicals rather than injectables in many jurisdictions.

### 4. Future Outlook

- **Hybrid Therapies:** Combining energy-based devices (RF microneedling) with immediate exosome application is becoming the gold standard for "non-surgical facelifts."
- **Home Care:** "Shelf-stable" plant-derived exosome serums are entering the premium consumer market.

### 5. Data Integrity Check

- **Validity:** High confidence in PN safety profile (decades of use in wound care).
- **Gap:** Long-term safety data for specific exosome sources still emerging.

### 6. Conclusion

Regenerative aesthetics prioritizes skin health and biological age reduction over mere volume replacement.
