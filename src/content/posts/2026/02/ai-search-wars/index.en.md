## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1.  **Hyper-Specific Constraints:** By explicitly forbidding "generic traditional SEO advice," the AI is forced to provide advanced, forward-looking strategies related to entity extraction and RAG.
2.  **Actionable Outputs:** Requesting exactly 3 gaps and 5 conversational queries ensures the output is immediately useful rather than an overwhelming wall of text.
