_"Even if you can't analyze the CEO's voice tone, you can read 'between the lines' of what they said."_

Earnings Calls of US companies are the most important events that determine the future stock price direction. However, it is difficult to listen to and understand over an hour of English discussion. If you have the script, AI perfectly analyzes the management's confidence, hidden bad news, and whether guidance is raised.
