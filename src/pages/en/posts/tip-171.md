_"Is it profitable to invest 100 million now to earn 200 million in 5 years? It depends on the interest rate."_

You shouldn't just look at the profit amount. The value of money changes over time. **NPV (Net Present Value)** and **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** are the golden rules of corporate investment decisions. The concepts are difficult, but if you use Excel functions, even an elementary school student can calculate them. AI will write the perfect template formula for you.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Understand NPV and IRR concepts based on Cash Flow data.
2. Create auto-calculation formulas using Excel `NPV` and `IRR` functions.
3. Provide investment judgment criteria according to changes in discount rate (interest rate).

### 📊 Investment Analysis Excel Formulas

**1. Calculate NPV (Net Present Value)**
- **Formula:** `=B2 + NPV(C2, B3:B7)`
- **Interpretation:** Simply add the initial investment (-100 million) and discount only the revenue from Year 1 onwards with the NPV function for accuracy.
- **Judgment:** If the result is **greater than 0**, invest! (A profitable business)

**2. Calculate IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**
- **Formula:** `=IRR(B2:B7)`
- **Interpretation:** Just select the entire range from initial investment to final revenue.
- **Judgment:** If the result (e.g., 15%) is **higher than the discount rate (10%)**, invest!

**💡 Summary:**
NPV shows the amount (How much do we earn?), and IRR shows the rate of return (What % do we earn?). It's best if both are satisfied.
