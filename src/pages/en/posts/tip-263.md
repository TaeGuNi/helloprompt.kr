_"Have you ever just spun your pen and closed your diary?"_

Blank page phobia also comes when writing a diary. 'Journaling', which reflects on your emotions and thoughts rather than simply listing what happened, is a great help to mental health. Hire AI as your own interviewer to ask questions.

2. The emotion of 'emptiness' might be a signal for you to pause for a moment. What do you think that signal is pointing to?
