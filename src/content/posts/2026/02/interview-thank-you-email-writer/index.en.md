## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is a secret weapon because it transforms a passive courtesy into an active pitch. In my experience reviewing hundreds of post-interview emails, 90% are boring, generic templates ("Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you"). By forcing the AI to incorporate a **Key Topic** and a **Supplement Point**, you prove that you were actively listening and that you are already thinking about their business problems. This is especially useful for technical or marketing roles where you might have frozen on a specific question—this is your chance to gracefully provide the perfect answer after the fact!

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Won't it sound like a robot wrote it?**
  - A: Not if you provide highly specific details in the `[Key Topic]` and `[Supplement Point]` fields. The AI provides the professional structure, but your unique conversational references provide the human soul. Always review and tweak the final output to match your personal speaking style.

- **Q: Who exactly should I send this to?**
  - A: Send it directly to the person (or people) who interviewed you. If you were interviewed by a panel, it's best to send slightly customized variations to each person, referencing a specific question that individual asked.

- **Q: What if I don't have anything to supplement or fix from my interview?**
  - A: That's a great position to be in! You can simply leave the `[Supplement Point]` out, or change it to an "Additional Idea"—e.g., "Thinking more about the marketing challenge you mentioned, I realized that approach X could also be very effective."

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Imprinting:** Assigning the "executive career coach" persona ensures the tone isn't overly subservient, but rather confident and professional.
2. **Contextual Anchoring:** Forcing the inclusion of a specific conversational hook bypasses generic AI output and proves active listening.
3. **Strategic Redirection:** The `Supplement Point` turns a moment of weakness during the interview into a demonstration of proactive problem-solving.
