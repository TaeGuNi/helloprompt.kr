_"100 English words memorized today become 50 tomorrow, and 10 remain after a week."_

The human brain is designed to forget. The only way to stop this is 'Spaced Repetition'. Looking at it again when you are about to forget. The problem is that calculating that timing is annoying. This prompt becomes your personal assistant and creates a schedule saying "Master, it's time to review".
