## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt acts as your personal local fixer. The true magic happens in the **Constraints** section—specifically the instruction to filter out places dominated by tourist reviews. While standard searches on Google Maps or TripAdvisor often bubble up restaurants with massive marketing budgets, this AI approach cross-references local sentiment to find the places where neighborhood residents actually eat. For the best results, always input your exact neighborhood (e.g., "Le Marais" instead of just "Paris") to get walkable, highly localized recommendations.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work with the free version of ChatGPT?**
  - A: Yes, it works well with free models. However, premium models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are generally better at parsing nuanced local reviews and avoiding hallucinations about restaurant operating hours.
- **Q: What if the AI recommends a place that is permanently closed?**
  - A: AI models have knowledge cutoffs. Always quickly verify the recommended restaurant's operating status on Google Maps before heading out!

- **Q: Can I use this for street food or cafes?**
  - A: Absolutely! Just change the 'Craving' variable from `[Authentic French Home Cooking]` to `[Local Street Food]` or `[Specialty Coffee Roaster]`.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** Assigning the "Michelin Guide inspector" persona forces the AI to elevate its standards and focus on culinary quality rather than just overall popularity.
2. **Hyper-Specific Context:** Providing exact budgets and neighborhoods narrows down the search space, preventing generic, city-wide lists.
3. **Negative Constraints:** Explicitly excluding tourist traps and hygiene issues dramatically improves the quality of the output, acting as a powerful filter against noisy data.
