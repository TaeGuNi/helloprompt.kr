## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is an absolute lifesaver for summer backpacking trips across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or Europe. Often, tourists assume "covering knees" means shorts are fine if they are long, only to be rejected because the fabric rides up when walking up temple stairs. By asking the AI specifically about "emergency fixes" (like renting a sarong at the Grand Palace in Bangkok or buying a paper shawl at the Vatican), you can confidently plan your day's outfit without carrying heavy extra clothes everywhere. I run this prompt every night while drafting my itinerary for the next day.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this prompt work well for lesser-known or local temples?**
  - A: Yes, but for very obscure, local shrines, the AI might lack highly specific data. In those cases, always apply the universal rule of thumb: cover your shoulders and knees, and remove hats and shoes if requested by signage.

- **Q: Can I just ask "What should I wear to the Vatican?" instead of using this long prompt?**
  - A: You can, but you'll likely get a generic, one-sentence answer. The Pro Version specifically targets the real pain points of travel—hot weather, gender-specific rules, and emergency cover-up rentals—giving you actionable, stress-relieving advice that a simple search won't provide.

## 🧬 Prompt Dissection (Why it works?)

1. **Contextualizing the Weather:** By explicitly stating "It will be very hot," the AI avoids suggesting heavy winter coats for modesty and focuses on breathable but compliant clothing options.
2. **Anticipating Failure (Rental Options):** Asking about on-site rentals proactively solves the problem of "what if I mess up," which is the biggest source of anxiety for travelers heading to strict religious sites.
3. **Holistic Etiquette (Bags & Photos):** Dress codes aren't just about clothes; backpacks and cameras often lead to entry denial or heavy fines. This prompt ensures all physical entry barriers are covered.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Basic Input)

```text
User: What should I wear to the Grand Palace in Bangkok?
AI: You should dress modestly. Cover your shoulders and knees.
```

### ✅ After (Pro Prompt Result)

```text
**Dress Code for the Grand Palace (Bangkok, Thailand)**

- **Tops:** Shoulders must be completely covered. No tank tops, sleeveless shirts, or see-through fabrics. (Applies to both men and women).
- **Bottoms:** Must cover the ankles. Men must wear long pants. Women can wear long pants or maxi skirts. No ripped jeans, leggings, or tight yoga pants.
- **Footwear:** Closed-toe shoes are preferred. Sandals with a heel strap are acceptable, but standard flip-flops are strictly prohibited.

**Emergency Fixes at the Entrance:**
If your outfit doesn't comply, you can no longer rent clothes inside. You must buy elephant pants or sarongs from the street vendors just outside the gates (approx. 100-200 THB).

**Baggage & Photography:**
- Large backpacks may be subject to search or denied entry.
- Photography is strictly prohibited inside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew). Do not point your feet at the Buddha statues when sitting.
