## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Rambling)

```text
"It was team project then, team member ghosted so it was hard...
Thought about telling professor but just did it myself?
Did it staying up all night and got good grade eventually. Really hard but proud."
(Emotion centered, core unclear)
```

### ✅ After (STAR Structuring)

```text
(Situation) "During team project, there was crisis where 3 people had to do 4 people's work due to member's departure."
(Task) "Project completion was unclear with one week left until deadline."
(Action) "Instead of redistributing roles, I proposed 'Core function priority implementation' strategy.
Boldly removed unnecessary functions, and finished server building I took charge of in 3 days helping team members."
(Result) "Thanks to that submitted in time receiving A+ grade, learned priority setting ability in crisis situation."
```
