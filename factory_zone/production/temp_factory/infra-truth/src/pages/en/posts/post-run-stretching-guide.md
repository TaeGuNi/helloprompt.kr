_"Did you go home feeling good about breaking your record today, but couldn't walk the next day?"_

As the running population increases, many people complain of 'Runner's Knee' or plantar fasciitis. Cool-down is not a choice but a necessity. Tell AI your running intensity and pain areas, and get a **recovery routine prescribed just for you**.
