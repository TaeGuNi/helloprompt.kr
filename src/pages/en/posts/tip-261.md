_"Did you go home feeling good about breaking your record today, but couldn't even walk the next day?"_

As the running population increases, many people complain of 'Runner's Knee' or plantar fasciitis. Cooling down is not a choice, but a necessity. Tell AI your running intensity and pain areas, and get a **recovery routine prescribed just for you**.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Adjusts the required stretching intensity according to the distance run and intensity.
2. Intensively cares for areas vulnerable to runners such as hamstrings, calves, and iliotibial band.
3. If you have a foam roller, it also teaches you massage methods using tools.
