_"I worked really hard on this project, but why does it look so lackluster when written down?"_

The value of a project lies in **'what problem was solved'**. Simply listing functions is just a manual. Transform your project into an attractive **'Problem Solving Story'**.

---

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Clearly define the project background (Problem) and solution process (Solution).
2. Separately describe my specific contribution (Role) and outcome (Impact).
3. Highlight 'Technical/Planning Challenges' that would interest the reader (interviewer).

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Listing Functions)

```text
Shopping Mall Website Creation Project
- Functions: Sign up, Product List, Cart, Payment
- Tech: React, Node.js, MongoDB
- I worked hard on it.
```

### ✅ After (Problem Solving Focus)

```markdown
### 🛍️ Building a Commerce Platform Capable of Handling High Traffic

**Background:** Started to solve the problem of server crashes during traffic spikes like Black Friday.

**Key Challenges:** A database bottleneck occurred with 10,000 concurrent users, causing page loading delays of over 3 seconds.

**My Solution:**

- **Redis Caching:** Introduced in-memory caching for frequently accessed product data to distribute DB load.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Separated heavy logic such as sending notifications after payment asynchronously using Kafka.

**Results:** Reduced average response time from 3.2 seconds to **0.5 seconds (84% reduction)** and decreased user churn rate by 10%.
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

Interviewers are more curious about **what you thought while making it** than what you made. 'Prove' your considerations and efforts with this prompt.

Even a small project can turn into a great story. ✨
