The prominent tech news site **Ars Technica** has retracted a story after it was discovered to contain fake quotes attributed to a Matplotlib maintainer. This incident is drawing attention as a stark example of the dangers of AI usage in journalism.

## The Incident

Around February 14, 2026, Ars Technica published an article co-authored by Benj Edwards and Kyle Orland. However, this article contained quotes that the maintainer of the open-source project **Matplotlib** had never spoken.

Users in the community (Hacker News and Mastodon) immediately raised questions. Specifically, the maintainer directly stated, "I never said that," revealing that the quoted content in the article was entirely fabricated.

## Traces of AI Hallucination

Ars Technica immediately pulled the article, but this incident signifies more than just a simple misreport. Many experts point out that it is highly likely a phenomenon of **AI Hallucination**, occurring during the process of writing or augmenting the article using Large Language Models (LLMs).

In particular, co-author Benj Edwards has been known as an enthusiastic supporter of AI technology. Concerns are rising that this incident foreshadows a decline in journalistic credibility caused by the indiscriminate use of generative AI tools.

## Crisis of Trust in Journalism

Traditional journalism has considered fact-checking and cross-verification as its lifeblood. However, criticism is mounting that these fundamental principles are being shaken due to competition for speed and the introduction of AI tools.

Ars Technica is a media outlet that has built a reputation for in-depth technical analysis articles over a long period. This incident has shocked readers and demonstrates the fatal consequences that can occur when AI-generated content is used without verification.

## Conclusion

AI is a powerful tool, but it does not guarantee truth. Journalists and editors must not blindly trust text generated by AI and must undergo a thorough verification process. The Ars Technica incident serves as a reminder of how crucial **'human verification'** is in the age of digital journalism.
