## 💡 Writer's Insight (Insight)

This prompt is an absolute game-changer during earnings season. When a company drops its quarterly earnings report, the market reacts in seconds. Instead of manually digging through the SEC Edgar database or complex PDFs, you can paste the raw 10-Q or 10-K text into an AI model (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or ChatGPT-4o, which excel at large context windows) and run this Pro Version prompt.

_Pro Tip:_ For the best results, don't just ask the AI to "look up" the data, as it might hallucinate or pull outdated numbers. Always copy and paste the actual income statement and balance sheet text directly below the prompt. It forces the AI to act strictly as an analytical engine rather than a search engine, guaranteeing high-fidelity insights.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I use the free version of ChatGPT for this?**
  - A: Yes, but it's highly recommended to use advanced models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 2.5 Pro. Financial analysis requires rigorous logic and large context windows, which the free tiers sometimes struggle with when handling long documents.

- **Q: How do I get the financial statement text to paste?**
  - A: You can visit Yahoo Finance, go to the 'Financials' tab of your target stock, and simply copy the text from the Income Statement and Balance Sheet. Alternatively, you can upload the official SEC 10-K PDF directly if your AI model supports file uploads.

- **Q: Will this prompt tell me exactly what stock to buy?**
  - A: No. The prompt is strictly designed to evaluate _fundamental health_, not to give financial advice. It will tell you if the company is bleeding cash or growing profitably, but you must make the final investment decision yourself.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** By assigning the persona of a "Wall Street Senior Equity Analyst," the AI automatically adopts a highly analytical, precise, and professional tone.
2. **Structured Outputs:** Forcing the AI to use Markdown tables and clear lists prevents the output from becoming a massive, unreadable wall of text.
3. **Anti-Hallucination Constraints:** The strict directive to analyze _only_ objective figures and to admit when missing data ("Warning" section) drastically reduces the risk of the AI making up financial numbers.
