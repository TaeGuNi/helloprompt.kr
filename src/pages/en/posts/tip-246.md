_"A child crying after shouting 'Just 10 more minutes!' and eventually getting it taken away—how long will you repeat this?"_

Taking it away by force only increases resistance. You need a 'negotiation' where the child sets the rules themselves and follows them. Create a fair contract using AI as a mediator.

2. Learning the importance of keeping promises
3. Reduction of parent-child conflict
