## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Just Accepting)

```text
"Thank you. I will join." (End)
-> Accept as given.
```

### ✅ After (Attempting Counter Offer)

```text
"I deeply appreciate the offer you proposed. Company A is my number one choice I really want to join.
However, to be honest, I am considering it because I received a slightly higher salary offer from another company.
If you could adjust my salary to 65,000, I would like to choose Company A without hesitation."
-> Success means 5,000 salary increase! Even if it fails, nothing to lose.
```
