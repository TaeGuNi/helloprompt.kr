There has been a recent surge in fake websites impersonating the popular open-source file archiver **7-Zip**, often appearing at the top of search results via ads.

## 🚨 What is Happening?

When users search for '7-Zip' or '7zip download' on search engines like Google or Bing, **fake websites** often appear as 'Sponsored' results above the official site (7-zip.org).

These fake sites mimic the design of the official homepage almost perfectly. However, clicking the download button delivers **malware** disguised as the 7-Zip installer.

### Risks and Symptoms

- **Info Stealers**: The installers often contain malware like RedLine Stealer or Lumma Stealer, which harvest passwords, cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet details from your browser.
- **Additional Payloads**: They may serve as a backdoor to install ransomware or other malicious software.
- **System Impact**: Some variants install cryptocurrency miners that degrade system performance.

## ✅ How to Stay Safe

### 1. Verify the Official Domain

The ONLY official website for 7-Zip is **[7-zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org/)**.
Always check the URL bar. Domains like `7zip-best.com` or `7-zip-official.org` are scams.

### 2. Check Digital Signatures

Before running the installer, verify its digital signature:

- Right-click the file -> Properties -> **Digital Signatures** tab.
- Ensure the signer's name is **Igor Pavlov**.

### 3. Verify Hashes (Optional)

While the official site doesn't always list hashes prominently, checking the file on VirusTotal is a good practice if you are unsure about the source.

## 🛡️ What if You Are Infected?

If you suspect you've installed a fake version recently:

1.  **Run a Full Scan**: Use reputable antivirus software to scan your system immediately.
2.  **Change Passwords**: Reset passwords for all accounts (especially those saved in your browser) and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
3.  **Uninstall**: Remove the suspicious program via Control Panel.

Always download open-source software from official channels. Share this alert to help others stay safe.
