_"Writing commit messages is harder than writing code..."_

`fix: bug`, `update code`... Are you committing like this?
Good commit messages are key to history management, but your brain hurts from writing them every time.
If you just throw the `git diff` content, we'll pull it out in the **Conventional Commits** style, which is the standard in the open-source world.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Analyze changes to automatically select appropriate types (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
2. Write concise and clear titles and detailed bodies
3. Formatting according to team conventions
