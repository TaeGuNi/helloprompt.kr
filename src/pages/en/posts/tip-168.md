### 🩺 Insurance Precision Diagnosis Report

**1. Key Problems**

- ❌ **Excessive Whole Life Insurance:** Spending 150,000 won a month on death coverage (100 million) when unmarried is inefficient. (Cost-effectiveness ⬇️)
- ⚠️ **Renewal Type Cancer Insurance:** It is cheap now but premiums can double in 10 years. Non-renewal type replacement needed.

**2. Coverage Gap (Gap Analysis)**

- **Brain/Heart:** Currently only cancer coverage exists and no diagnosis fee for 2 major diseases (Cerebrovascular, Ischemic Heart).

**3. Remodeling Proposal (Goal: 120,000 won/month)**

1. **Insurance A (Whole Life):** Take action to stop paying by cancelling or using 'Paid-up Insurance' system.
2. **Insurance C (Cancer):** After cancellation, switch to 'Non-renewal Type Children's Insurance (Adult Children's Insurance)' and configure Cancer+Brain+Heart diagnosis fees as a set (Expected about 100,000 won).
3. **Insurance B (Indemnity):** Must maintain.

**👉 Expected Result:** Coverage range widens and premium reduced by 130,000 won/month.
