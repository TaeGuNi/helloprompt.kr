_"Read 100 books? You fail because you set it too big. AI helps design something very small and trivial, so you have no choice but to succeed."_

Habit is not willpower but environment setting. Apply the principle of 'Atomic Habits' to create your own habit tracker where failure is impossible.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input the goal (habit) you want to make.
2. Break it down into 'very small actions' applying brain science principles.
