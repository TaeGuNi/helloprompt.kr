The tech world is drowning in noise. We call it innovation; users call it exhaustion.

## The Problem
This post explores the critical issue of **ax-reality**. While executives cheer for metrics, the reality on the ground is different. We are seeing a massive disconnect between promise and delivery. 

> "AX is just digital transformation with a new sticker."

This isn't just a glitch. It's a systemic failure.

## The Reality
Why are we ignoring the signs? Italian speakers and users globally are starting to reject the hype. We need to stop pretending that more is better.

## Conclusion
It's time to wake up. The bubble isn't bursting; it's leaking toxic sludge everywhere.
