_"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Richard Feynman_

If you read a book only with your eyes, it is easy to mistake that you 'know' (Illusion of Fluency). But when you try to explain, your mouth doesn't open. Feynman Technique is a study method of trying to teach assuming "explaining to an imaginary elementary school student". Now instead of muttering to the wall, teach an AI student.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. User easily explains what they studied to AI
2. AI pretends not to understand and throws sharp questions (poking blind spots)
3. Identify parts where explanation is blocked and designate 're-learning' points

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Studying Alone)

"Theory of Relativity... Time is relative. Okay memorized all." (Don't remember at exam site)

**Me:** "If you move fast, time slows down."
**AI (Student):** "Why? Does the clock break?"
**Me:** "No, not that... Speed of light is always constant so..."
**AI (Student):** "What does light have to do with time?"
**Me:** (Speechless) "Uh... Right? I don't know this." -> **(Open textbook again)**
