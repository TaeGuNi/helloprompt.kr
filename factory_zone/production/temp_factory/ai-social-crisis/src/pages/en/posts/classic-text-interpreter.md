## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input - From US Declaration of Independence)

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal..."

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

**[Modern Translation]**
"We believe following truths are obvious enough not to need explanation. That is, all men are born equal..."

**[Reading Between Lines]**
This sentence is not simply moral claim "Let's be equal". It is **Political Attack** declaring that colonial rule of then British King (George III) is illegal act going against 'Law of Nature'. It is revolutionary message "King, you are also just human made by God, cannot reign over us".

**[Keyword Commentary]**

- _Self-evident_: Truth that doesn't even need proof. Word showing confidence of Age of Reason (Enlightenment).

**[One Line Review]**
Historical document that shattered Divine Right of Kings (King's power given by God) and clarified Natural Rights, foundation of democracy.
