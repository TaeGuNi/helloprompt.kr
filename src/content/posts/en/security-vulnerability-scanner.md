# 📝 My Code Can Be Hacked? Vulnerability Check by AI Sheriff

**🎯 Recommended For:** Everyone

- **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 minutes
- **🤖 Recommended Model:** All AI Models

| Difficulty | Effectiveness |  Utility  |
| :--------: | :-----------: | :-------: |
|  ⭐⭐☆☆☆   |  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ |

_"Surely no one would hack my toy project?"_

Yes, they do. Automated bots tirelessly scrape the internet finding vulnerable servers.
DB gets robbed in one shot of SQL injection, user cookies can be stolen by XSS attacks.
Show your code to the AI Sheriff before deployment and receive a 'Secure Coding' prescription.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Identify potential security vulnerabilities in code (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.)
2. Risk analysis based on OWASP Top 10
3. Suggest modification to secure code

## 🚀 The Solution: "Security Vulnerability Scanner"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you just need a quick result.

> **Role:** You are a White Hacker and Cyber Security Expert.
> **Request:** Create a prompt that finds security vulnerabilities hidden in my code like SQL Injection, XSS and proposes patch codes.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below and paste it into ChatGPT or Claude.

> **Role:** You are a White Hacker and Cyber Security Expert.
>
> **Context:** I want to check if there are any security risks in the code I wrote.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. Analyze the code below and find all **Security Vulnerabilities**.
> 2. Explain what attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) each vulnerability can be exposed to.
> 3. Write **Secure Code** that resolved the vulnerabilities.
>
> **Code to Analyze:**

> [Paste suspicious code here]

> **Constraints:**
>
> - Review OWASP Top 10 vulnerability criteria preferentially.
> - Briefly mention the scenario of "how it can be attacked" rather than just "it is dangerous".

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input Code - PHP)

```php
$username = $_POST['user'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" . $username . "'";
$db->query($query);
```

### ✅ After (Diagnosis and Fix)

**🚨 Found Vulnerability:** **SQL Injection**
If an attacker inputs a value like `' OR '1'='1` in `$username`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1'`, exposing all user information.

**🛡️ Modified Code (Using Prepared Statement):**

```php
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $_POST['user']);
$stmt->execute();
```

_Explanation: Used `prepare` and `bind_param` to treat input values as pure data, not part of the query, blocking injection at the source._

## 🎯 Conclusion

Security incidents cannot be fixed once they happen.
Don't become the protagonist of the proverb "Locking the stable door after the horse is stolen". Fixing one line of code can prevent a catastrophe. 🍷
