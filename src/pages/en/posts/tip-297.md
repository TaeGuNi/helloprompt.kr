_"It's too wasteful to stay in the hotel room on a travel night, right?"_

New York's jazz, Berlin's techno, Seville's flamenco... The real vibe of that city is in the music. Find a real stage where locals drink beer and ride the rhythm, not a show for tourists.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Recommend local clubs/bars by genre that fit my music taste.
2. Check Cover Charge, reservation method, dress code.
