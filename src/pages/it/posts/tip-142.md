# 📝 Bug Hunter: Debugging Prompt to Catch Errors in 1 Minute

> **🎯 Recommended For:** Everyone
> **⏱️ Time Required:** 5 minutes

_"NullPointerException? Where on earth is it Null?"_

It is said that 80% of development time is spent on debugging. Error messages are unfriendly, and code is too complex. Instead of staring at the monitor until your eyes pop out, ask AI. It never gets tired and scans thousands of lines of code in 1 second.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Analyze error messages and related code to identify the **Root Cause**.
2. Provide **Fixed Code** along with an explanation of why it needs to be fixed.
3. Suggest **Defensive Code** to prevent recurrence.

## 🚀 Solution: "Error Terminator"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are a `[Genius Bug Hunter and Software Engineer]`.
> **Request:** When I provide an unknown error message and code, find the bug's location and the solution (Fix).

### 🥇 Pro Version (Expert)

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** content below and use it.

> **Role:** You are a `[Genius Bug Hunter and Software Engineer]`.
>
> **Context:** I executed the code, but an error occurred or an unwanted result came out. I can't find the cause.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. **[Root Cause Analysis]**: Interpret the error message and pinpoint exactly which part of the code is the problem. (Is it a logical error or a syntax error?)
> 2. **[Solution]**: Show the code with the bug fixed. (Mark the changed parts with comments)
> 3. **[Prevention]**: Tell me what habits I should have to avoid making this mistake in the future, or 'exception handling' code that would be good to add.
>
> **Error Message:**
>
> ```text
> [Paste the error log here]
> ```
>
> **Written Code:**
>
> ```text
> [Paste the problematic code here]
> ```

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Situation)

`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` occurred in JavaScript.
(Beginner: "Map? Why is a map coming out?")

### ✅ After (Prompt Result)

**[Root Cause Analysis]**
It happened because you tried to render the screen before receiving data from the API. The variable `userList` is in an `undefined` state because data hasn't arrived yet, but you used the `.map()` function on it, causing an error. It's an asynchronous processing issue.

**[Solution]**

```text
// Before fix: userList.map(...)
// After fix: Use optional chaining (?.)
userList?.map(user => ...)
```

I attached the `?.` operator to execute map only when data exists.

**[Prevention]**
When writing API communication code, it is good to always assume that 'data might arrive late' or 'it might fail' and insert code like `if (!data) return loading...` first.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Bugs are not failures. They are the process of code becoming more perfect. (Of course, a bug right before leaving work is a disaster. Catch it quickly.)

Now go home on time and enjoy a bug-free life! 🍷
