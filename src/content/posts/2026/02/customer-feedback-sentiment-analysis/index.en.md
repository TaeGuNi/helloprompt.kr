## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt completely changed how I handle weekly reporting. When you dump a raw Excel column of reviews into an AI, the key is to ask for **"Actionable Items"** rather than just a summary. By forcing the AI to act as a "Senior CS Expert," it shifts its tone from a simple text summarizer to a strategic consultant.

**Pro Tip:** If you have thousands of rows, you might hit the context window limit of the AI. In that case, use Claude 3.5 Sonnet (which has a massive context window) or sample a random 20% of your data to get a statistically significant sentiment overview without breaking the AI.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with messy, typo-filled reviews or slang?**
  - A: Yes! Modern LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 are incredibly good at understanding context, slang, and typos. You don't need to clean the data before pasting it.

- **Q: How much data can I paste at once?**
  - A: It depends on the model. For ChatGPT (Plus), you can comfortably paste a few hundred rows. If you use Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 Pro, you can literally drop in a CSV file with thousands of rows at once.

- **Q: Can I use this for App Store or Google Play reviews?**
  - A: Absolutely. You can just copy the text from your review tracking tool or scrape the page, dump it into the prompt, and the AI will perfectly categorize the app feedback.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1. **Role Playing:** Assigning the "Senior CS Quality Management Expert" role ensures the output uses professional business terminology rather than casual language.
2. **Structured Outputs:** By explicitly requesting ratios, top 3 keywords, and action items, you force the AI to organize the chaos into a highly readable, executive-friendly format.
3. **Anti-Hallucination Constraints:** The "Warning" section prevents the AI from inventing complaints that don't exist in the text, ensuring your report remains factually accurate.
