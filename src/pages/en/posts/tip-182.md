## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Plan a time travel girl group concept."

### ✅ After (Planning Result)

- **Album Name:** <REWIND: 1999>
- **Visual:** A mix-match of late 20th-century end-of-century vibes + futuristic hologram outfits.
- **Universe:** The members came from the future but crash-landed in 1999 due to a time machine malfunction. They try to send a message to their past selves, but only noise is transmitted.
- **Lyrics (Hook):**
  _"Glitch Mode, you're creaking / Against time, Back to you / (Oh-eh-oh) / A signal almost touching but not quite / Precariously connected as if about to break"_
