## 💡 작성자 코멘트 (Insight)

As someone who once returned from a vacation feeling more exhausted than before I left, I realized that traditional travel planning is essentially unpaid labor. This prompt acts as your personal retreat planner. By explicitly instructing the AI to focus on "one main activity per day" and removing the pressure of "must-see" landmarks, you force the AI to uncover hidden gems—like a quiet local library or a serene coastal walking path. It’s highly effective for digital nomads or anyone suffering from severe burnout who simply needs permission to do nothing.

## 🙋 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well for bustling cities like Tokyo or New York?**
  - A: Absolutely! Even in major metropolises, the AI can curate a "slow travel" experience by focusing on quiet residential neighborhoods, hidden gardens, local coffee roasters, and off-peak hours for museums.

- **Q: Can I use this for a shorter weekend trip?**
  - A: Yes. Simply change the goal in the prompt from "1-week restorative trip" to "3-day weekend retreat," and the AI will adjust the pacing accordingly.

## 🧬 프롬프트 해부 (Why it works?)

1. **Role Assignment:** By designating the AI as a "Wellness Travel Curator" rather than a standard travel guide, it immediately shifts the tone from energetic sightseeing to mindful relaxation.
2. **Clear Constraints:** The strict rule to "exclude famous, crowded landmarks" prevents the AI from defaulting to typical tourist recommendations, ensuring a genuinely unique and peaceful itinerary.
3. **Pacing Rules:** Mandating "one main activity per day" structurally eliminates the possibility of an overwhelming schedule.
