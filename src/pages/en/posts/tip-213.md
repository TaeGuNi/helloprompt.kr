_"If the interviewer's face darkens while you are explaining hard?"_

The reason for failing most interviews is **'rambling'**. You explain the situation for 3 minutes and end up unable to say what you actually did. Build the skeleton of your answer with the all-purpose cheat key **STAR Method**.

## ⚡️ TL;DR

1. Input the experience episode I want to talk about.
2. AI rearranges the content into **S(Situation)-T(Task)-A(Action)-R(Result)** structure.
3. Complete it as a script of about 1 minute that you can say right away in the interview room.

## 🧬 Why it works?

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Rambling)

```text
"It was a team project back then, and it was hard because a team member ghosted us...
I thought about telling the professor but just did it all myself?
I stayed up all night doing it and eventually got a good grade. It was really hard but I was proud."
(Emotion-centered, unclear core)
```

### ✅ After (STAR Structuring)

```text
(Situation) "During a team project, there was a crisis where 3 people had to do the work of 4 due to a team member leaving."
(Task) "With one week left until the deadline, project completion was unclear."
(Action) "Instead of redistributing roles, I proposed a 'core function first implementation' strategy.
We boldly removed unnecessary functions, and I finished the server construction I was in charge of in 3 days to help team members."
(Result) "Thanks to this, we submitted within the deadline and received an A+ grade, and I learned priority setting skills in crisis situations."
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

STAR is like memorizing the multiplication table of interviews. Once you learn this frame, you can logically strike back without panicking no matter what question comes in.

Now your story becomes a 'legend', not just a 'yarn'. 🌟
