_"Are you eating less rice these days? Is your nose dry?"_

Animals hide pain instinctively. By the time the owner notices, it is often serious. Record the pet's condition periodically and ask AI. It acts as a primary screener to determine if a hospital visit is needed.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Input checklist of major health indicators (Appetite, Bowel movements, Activity level, etc.).
2. AI analyzes symptoms and warns of suspected diseases.

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

---

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"The dog is vomiting."

### ✅ After (Result)

**Analysis:** Since it's an old dog (10 years old), slight vomiting + lethargy can be a sign of 'Pancreatitis' or 'Kidney failure'.
**Check:** Check if there is blood in vomit / Check if gums are pale.
**Advice:** Fast for 12 hours and if vomiting continues, go to the hospital immediately.
