_"Ah... what should I film tomorrow? When do I write the script..."_

The core of Short-form (Shorts/Reels/TikTok) is **'Consistency'** and **'First 3 Seconds'**. But squeezing out viral ideas daily is not humanly possible. Now, let's inject the **'Viral Formula'** into AI and build a factory that prints scripts just by breathing.

2.  Command AI to strictly follow this formula.
3.  Throw a topic, get a shooting guide (Visual + Audio).

## 🧬 Anatomy of Prompt (Why it works?)

1.  **Force Structure (Hook-Body-CTA):** We fix the structure in the prompt. This prevents AI from writing boring intros.
2.  **Visual/Audio Split:** YouTubers need not just 'what to say' but **'what to show'**. Directing screen composition in a Table reduces editing time.
