## The Paradox of the AI Era: Finding Humans Again

IBM has been one of the most aggressive adopters of AI in recent years. They publicly stated plans to replace entry-level tasks with AI. However, in 2026, IBM has reached a surprising turning point: announcing plans to **triple entry-level hiring**.

### Why Suddenly Increase Entry-Level Hiring?

According to IBM's Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), this is because they realized AI cannot replace everything.

1.  **Limits of AI**: While AI excels at repetitive tasks, human intervention remains essential for complex problem-solving, creative thinking, and most importantly, understanding 'context'.
2.  **Future Talent Pipeline**: If you don't hire entry-level employees, future middle managers and leaders disappear. If AI does all the junior work, juniors lose the opportunity to grow. IBM is widening the doors again to prevent this.
3.  **Potential of Gen Z**: Digital native Gen Z employees utilize AI tools better than anyone. IBM aims to nurture them not as 'those replaced by AI', but as 'super talents who achieve results using AI'.

### Implications

This is not just IBM's story. Many tech companies shouted "cost reduction with AI", but are eventually returning to the basic principle that "people are the competitive edge".

AI is merely a tool; the one wielding that tool remains human. IBM's decision will serve as a case study proving that even in the AI era, human labor, especially the value of entry-level employees with growth potential, remains valid.
