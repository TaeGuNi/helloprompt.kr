## Fear Grips the Market, Where is Reason?

The sharp decline in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector that has hit global stock markets in recent days is unusual. Major analysts are diagnosing this phenomenon as an **'Emotional Sell-off'**, caused by amplified vague anxieties among investors, rather than changes in fundamentals such as corporate earnings or technical defects.

### What is the Cause of the Sell-off?

1.  **Reignited Valuation Concerns**: Fatigue has accumulated regarding the valuations of AI leaders that have rallied non-stop for the past few years.
2.  **Desire for Profit Taking**: The psychology to realize profits on assets that have surged in a short period triggered a chain reaction of selling.
3.  **Macroeconomic Uncertainty**: With opaque interest rate policies and geopolitical risks overlapping, a "sell first, ask later" mentality has spread.

### Expert Diagnosis

Veteran Wall Street investment strategist James Carter emphasized, "The current selling lacks logical basis," and "The adoption of AI technology is just in its early stages, and the long-term growth story remains valid." He added that this correction could actually be an attractive entry point for long-term investors.

## Future Outlook

Volatility is likely to persist in the short term. Time is needed for investor sentiment to stabilize. However, once emotional factors are resolved, the market will once again focus on intrinsic values such as earnings and growth potential.

*   **Investment Advice**: Instead of selling in panic, it is a time for calmness to re-examine the cash flow and technical moat of the companies you hold.
