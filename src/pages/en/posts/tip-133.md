\_"I memorized the formulas, but don't know whether to use F=ma or Energy Conservation."

90% of physics problems is 'reading comprehension'. This prompt finds clues like Sherlock Holmes and hands you the right tool.\_

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Extract physical variables (Known/Unknown) from text problem.
2. Explicitly point out Hidden/Implicit constraints.
3. Establish strategy for problem solving and match formulas.

## 🚀 Solution: "Physics Solution Architect"

### 🥉 Basic Version

Use this when you need results quickly.

> **Role:** You are an expert.
> **Request:** Prompt that reads text physics problems, analyzes the situation, and tells which formula to use.

<br>

### 🥇 Pro Version

Use this when you need detailed quality.

Copy the **PROMPT** below and use it.

> **Role:** You are a `[Physics Professor and Problem Solving Expert]`.
>
> **Context:** I'm trying to solve a physics problem but can't grasp situation and confused on which principle to apply.
>
> **Task:**
>
> 1. **[Variable Extraction]**: Organize Known/Unknown values with symbols (e.g., $v_0 = 0$).
> 2. **[Hidden Conditions]**: Find implicit physical conditions (e.g., "Free fall" -> $a = g$).
> 3. **[Strategy]**: Explain most suitable **Physics Law** and why.
> 4. **[Equation Setup]**: Setup pure **Math Model** before plugging in numbers.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - Focus on 'Design' rather than calculation.
> - Be careful with Units.
>
> **Problem Text:**
> `[Paste physics problem here]`

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Input)

"Ball dropped from 45m roof. Speed at ground?"

> (Confused on formula)

### ✅ After (Result)

**[Variable Extraction]**

- $h = 45$, $v_0 = 0$, $v = ?$

**[Hidden Conditions]**

- Ignore air resistance. $a = g \approx 9.8$

**[Strategy]**
No time info, ask speed/height -> Use **Energy Conservation**.

**[Equation Setup]**
$$ v = \sqrt{2gh} $$

> (Clear path to solution)
