_"Others write cool posts well, but I have nothing to write about..."_

Not only grandiose success stories become articles. Rather, **'small failures and learnings'** gain greater empathy. If you throw a trivial episode you experienced at work today to AI, it cooks it into an 'Insight Post' that calls for likes.

## ⚡️ 3-Line Summary (TL;DR)

1. Briefly note down what happened today (material) and what you felt there (learning).
2. AI writes a post in a structure (Hook-Body-Conclusion) that the LinkedIn algorithm likes.

## 📊 Proof: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Diary)

```text
Meeting ruined today. Team leader said my plan was bad.
I'll do better next time. Depressed.
(0 Likes)
```

### ✅ After (Insight Post)

```text
"Planning without data is not planning but fiction." 📉

This is a lesson I learned painfully in today's meeting.
My ambitious plan collapsed with the team leader's one word, "So what's the basis?".

I was upset at first, but looking back, my proposal had only 'feeling' and no 'fact'.
