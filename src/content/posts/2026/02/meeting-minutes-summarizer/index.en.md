## 💡 Writer's Insight

This prompt is an absolute lifesaver for anyone dealing with client calls or extensive internal strategy meetings. Raw transcripts generated by AI tools (like Whisper or Zoom transcripts) are great, but nobody wants to read a 10-page script of people talking over each other.

By assigning the "Project Manager" persona and explicitly defining the four structural pillars (Agenda, Discussions, Decisions, Action Items), the AI knows exactly how to filter out the noise. The most crucial part of this prompt is the strict instruction to extract the _Person in Charge_ and _Deadline_. This single constraint turns a passive summary into an actionable document that drives the project forward.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Does this work well with long transcripts (e.g., over an hour)?**
  - A: Yes, but keep in mind the token limits of your chosen AI model. For very long meetings (e.g., 2+ hours), using models with large context windows like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Gemini 1.5 Pro is highly recommended over standard free models.

- **Q: Can the AI understand industry-specific jargon?**
  - A: Generally, yes. However, if your meeting contains heavy internal acronyms, you can improve the output by adding a small glossary section to the "Context" part of the prompt (e.g., "- Note: Q1 means First Quarter, KPI means Key Performance Indicator").

## 🧬 Prompt Anatomy (Why it works?)

1.  **Role Assignment:** Giving the AI the dual persona of a "Project Manager and Stenographer" ensures it focuses on both accuracy (stenography) and actionable outcomes (project management).
2.  **Structural Constraints:** Mandating specific sections forces the AI to categorize unstructured thoughts, drastically improving the readability of the final output.
3.  **Hallucination Prevention:** The explicit warning to mark missing details as "TBD" prevents the AI from confidently guessing deadlines, which could lead to massive miscommunications.
